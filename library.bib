abstract = {Equitable liver allocation should ensure that nonelective removal rates are fairly distributed among waiting candidates. We compared removal rates for adults entered with nonmalignant (NM) (N = 9379) and hepatocellular cancer (HCC) (N = 2052) diagnoses on the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) list between April 30, 2003, and December 31, 2004. Unadjusted removal rates for NM vs. HCC diagnoses were 9.4{\%} vs. 8.7{\%}, 13.5{\%} vs. 16.9{\%} and 19.1{\%} vs. 31.8{\%} at 90, 180 and 365 days, respectively after listing. For NM candidates, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score (RR = 1.16), age (RR = 1.03) and metabolic disease diagnoses (RR = 1.66) had higher risks of removal; and PSC (RR = 0.62) and alcoholic cirrhosis (RR = 0.82) had lower risks of removal. For HCC candidates, MELD score at listing (RR = 1.09), AFP (RR = 1.02), maximum tumor size (RR = 1.16) and age at listing (RR = 1.02) had increased risks of removal. The equation 1 - 0.920 exp[0.09369 (MELD at listing - 12.48) + 0.00193 (AFP - 97.4) + 0.1505 (maximum tumor size - 2.59) defined the probability of dropout for HCC candidates within 90 days of listing. We conclude that factors associated with the risk of removal for HCC are different from NM candidates, although MELD score at listing remains the most predictive for both groups. Liver transplant candidates with HCC may be prioritized using a risk score analogous to the MELD score. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Authors.},

abstract = {The SRTR maintains the liver-simulated allocation model (LSAM), a tool for estimating the impact of changes to liver allocation policy. Integral to LSAM is a model that predicts the decision to accept or decline a liver for transplant. LSAM implicitly assumes these decisions are made identically for adult and pediatric liver transplant (LT) candidates, which has not been previously validated. We applied LSAM's decision-making models to SRTR offer data from 2013 to 2016 to determine its efficacy for adult (≥18) and pediatric ({\textless}18) LT candidates, and pediatric subpopulations—teenagers (≥12 to {\textless}18), children (≥2 to {\textless}12), and infants ({\textless}2)—using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). For nonstatus 1A candidates, all pediatric subgroups had higher rates of offer acceptance than adults. For non-1A candidates, LSAM's model performed substantially worse for pediatric candidates than adults (AUC 0.815 vs. 0.922); model performance decreased with age (AUC 0.898, 0.806, 0.783 for teenagers, children, and infants, respectively). For status 1A candidates, LSAM also performed worse for pediatric than adult candidates (AUC 0.711 vs. 0.779), especially for infants (AUC 0.618). To ensure pediatric candidates are not unpredictably or negatively impacted by allocation policy changes, we must explicitly account for pediatric-specific decision making in LSAM.},

abstract = {Medical decompressive therapy (MDT) with corticosteroids and mannitol is often used in patients with primary or metastatic brain tumours. This review highlights the lack of sound evidence regarding the indications and dosage schedule of steroids, prolonged use of which may cause debilitating complications. The available evidence supports the short-term use of MDT for raised intracranial pressure or progressive neurological deficits, but in the absence of these symptoms, MDT is not recommended for stable focal deficits, abnormal higher mental functions, seizures, or as prophylaxis during cranial irradiation. A practical stepladder guideline (based on symptom severity) is proposed with a starting daily dexamethasone dose of 6 mg for non-severe headache and or vomiting; 12 mg for progressive focal neurological deficit with or without non-severe headache or vomiting; and 24 mg dexamethasone with mannitol for severe headache, vomiting, or altered consciousness. Depending on the clinical response, dose can be increased to the next step(s) or tapered every 48 h (more slowly in patients who are dependent on steroids). A scheme for the assessment of efficacy and toxicity prevention is also proposed. The proposed guidelines may be used as a template for further clinical research.},

abstract = {Background: Treatment decisions for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are complex and require trade-offs between the benefits and risks experienced by patients. We evaluated the benefits that patients judged sufficient to compensate for the risks associated with therapy for NSCLC. Methods: Participants with a self-reported diagnosis of NSCLC (n= 100) were sampled from an online panel in the United Kingdom. Eligible and consenting participants then completed a self-administered online survey about their disease and their treatment preferences were assessed. This involved respondents choosing among systematically paired profiles that spanned eight attributes: progression-free survival [PFS], symptom severity, rash, diarrhoea, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, fever and infection, and mode of treatment administration (infusion and oral). A choice model was estimated using mixed-logit regression. Estimates of importance for each attribute level and attribute were then calculated and acceptable tradeoffs among attributes were explored. Results: A total of 89 respondents (73{\%} male) completed all choice tasks appropriately. Increases in PFS together with improvements in symptom severity were judged most important and increased with PFS benefit - 4 months: 5.7; 95{\%} CI: 3.5-7.9; 5 months: 7.1; 95{\%} CI: 4.4-9.9; and 7 months: 10.0; 95{\%} CI: 6.1-13.9. However, improvements in PFS were viewed as most beneficial when disease symptoms were mild and as detrimental when patients had severe symptoms. Fatigue (5.0; 95{\%} CI: 2.7-7.3) was judged to be the most important risk, followed by diarrhoea (2.8; 95{\%} CI: 0.7-4.9), nausea and vomiting (2.1; 95{\%} CI: 0.1-4.1), fever and infection (2.1; 95{\%} CI: 0.2-4.1), and rash (2.0; 95{\%} CI: 0.2-3.9). Oral administration was preferred to infusion (1.8; 95{\%} CI: 0.0-3.6). Patients with mild and moderate symptoms traded PFS for less risks or more convenience if the severe symptoms were not experienced. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the value of conjoint analysis in the study of patient preferences for cancer treatments. In this small sample of patients with NSCLC from the UK, we demonstrate that the value of improvements in PFS is conditional upon the severity of disease symptoms; and that risks are valued differently. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: The Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) was originally developed based on data from patients who underwent the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure. An updated MELD based on data from patients awaiting liver transplantation should improve mortality prediction and allocation efficiency. Methods: Wait-list data from adult primary liver transplantation candidates from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network were divided into a model derivation set (20052006; n = 14,214) and validation set (20072008; n = 13,945). Cox regression analysis was used to derive and validate an optimized model that updated coefficients and upper and lower bounds for MELD components and included serum levels of sodium. Main outcomes measure was ability to predict 90-day mortality of patients on the liver transplantation wait list. Results: Optimized MELD score updated coefficients and implemented new upper and lower bounds for creatinine (0.8 and 3.0 mg/dL, respectively) and international normalized ratio (1 and 3, respectively). Serum sodium concentrations significantly predicted mortality, even after adjusting for the updated MELD model. The final model, based on updated fit of the 4 variables (ie, bilirubin, creatinine, international normalized ratio, and sodium) had a modest yet statistically significant gain in discrimination (concordance: 0.878 vs 0.865; P {\textless} .01) in the validation dataset. Utilization of the new score could affect up to 12{\%} of patients (based on changed score for 459 of 3981 transplants in the validation set). Conclusions: Modification of MELD score to update coefficients, change upper and lower bounds, and incorporate serum sodium levels improved wait-list mortality prediction and should increase efficiency of allocation of donated livers. {\textcopyright} 2011 AGA Institute.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The pharyngocutaneous fistula (PCF) is a serious complication after total laryngectomy, and its etiology is not well understood yet. The aim of our study was to evaluate predisposing factors, incidence, and management of this complication. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a retrospective study of 268 patients who underwent total laryngectomy in our clinic (January 1990-December 2001). A number of factors potentially predisposing to PCF formation were evaluated. RESULTS: A PCF was observed in 16{\%} of patients. Systemic diseases, previous radiotherapy, supraglottic origin of tumor, and concurrent radical neck dissection were significantly associated with PCF. Spontaneous closure was noted in 28 patients, whereas a surgical closure was necessary in 15 patients. CONCLUSIONS: In presence of a specific risk factor, PCF can be expected; nevertheless, its prevention remains very difficult. Moreover, given the high percentage of spontaneous closure, we suggest the "wait and see" approach for 28 days before proceeding with a surgical approach. EBM RATING: C.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW The most difficult, and perhaps, most important decision that a clinician makes for a patient on the liver transplant wait-list is when 'not' to proceed with liver transplant. Although an individual may be suitable for transplant surgery at listing, he/she may become too sick while waiting. RECENT FINDINGS This article reviews four specific conditions that commonly arise on the wait-list that may render a candidate too sick for transplant: advancing age, sarcopenia, acute on chronic liver failure, and nonliver-related medical comorbidities. Each condition, per se, is often not a criterion for delisting; the challenge arises when conditions exist in combination--how does one 'sum' up these conditions to quantify risk? Physical frailty, conceptually, represents the conditions in a candidate that are unlikely to reverse after liver function returns, or will take so long to reverse that the patient will be highly vulnerable to postoperative complications. Pretransplant assessments of physical frailty, which are objective, easily administered, and repeated in the clinical setting, enable us to measure the extent to which these factors, in isolation or combination, will reduce both quantity and quality of life after liver transplant. SUMMARY In this article, I introduce a framework that incorporates objective pretransplant assessments of physical frailty to facilitate the decision regarding when a patient is too sick for transplant.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES AND HYPOTHESIS: Isshiki type one medialisation thyroplasty is an accepted treatment for a unilateral immobile vocal fold. It can also be performed simultaneously as a bilateral procedure in patients with severe bowing of the vocal folds (e.g. presbyphonia). The objectives of this study were to assess the incidence and timing of post-operative complications, and to evaluate whether patients undergoing this operation could, in future, be treated as day cases. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was undertaken of 57 consecutive patients who had undergone a type one thyroplasty (52 unilateral and five bilateral) at a tertiary referral centre between April 2003 and April 2006. Post-operative improvement in the voice (measured subjectively, perceptually and quantitatively) was considered to constitute a successful outcome. Any complications were documented. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients who had undergone laryngeal framework surgery were recruited from the study database. All of these patients had undergone either unilateral or bilateral type one medialisation thyroplasty but no arytenoid surgery. Thirty-seven were male (65 per cent) and 20 female (35 per cent), and there was left-sided predominance (74 per cent). All patients were discharged the morning following afternoon surgery (i.e. within 24 hours). Complications occurred in four patients (7 per cent). One patient, who was taking warfarin, developed a post-operative haematoma which resolved with conservative treatment. Two patients (both of whom had undergone revision thyroplasty) developed a wound infection three days post-operatively, which resolved with antibiotics. One patient returned with hoarseness five months post-operatively, after an initially successful result. This patient had previously received radiotherapy for early glottic carcinoma, and the Silastic implant was eroding through the mucosa. This was subsequently removed under general anaesthesia. No patients developed complications leading to airway compromise. CONCLUSION: The only complications in this series were in patients taking anticoagulation medication, undergoing revision surgery, or in whom the laryngeal tissue was atrophic or absent. Careful patient selection to exclude any of the above should reduce the risk of complications. The authors would therefore advocate type one thyroplasty for unilateral or bilateral vocal fold paralysis as a suitable procedure for day-case surgery within our department.},

abstract = {Among 2528 patients operated on using pins, rods, bolts, and screws made of polyglycolic acid or polylactic acid, 108 (4.3{\%}) were affected by a clinically significant local inflammatory, sterile tissue reaction. The three most common indications for the use of these fixation devices were a displaced malleolar fracture, a chevron osteotomy for hallux valgus, and a displaced fracture of the radial head. In 107 patients, the reaction was elicited by a polyglycolic acid implant, and in one patient by a polylactic acid implant. The incidences were 5.3{\%} (107 of 2037) and 0.2{\%} (one of 491), respectively. The adverse tissue responses to polyglycolic acid were seen 11 weeks after the operation, on average, whereas the reaction to polylactic acid occurred 4.3 years after fixation of an ankle fracture. The mild reactions consisted of a painful erythematous papule of a few weeks' duration. Those of medium severity had a sinus that discharged remnants of the implant for up to 6 months. In the patients affected by severe reactions, extensive osteolytic lesions developed at the implant tracks. The histopathologic picture was that of a nonspecific foreign body reaction. In four patients with vigorous reactions, an arthrodesis of the wrist or ankle later was necessary because of severe osteoarthritis. Several markers of increased risk of the occurrence of a foreign body reaction were found. These included a poorly vascularized bone section such as scaphoid, use of a quinone dye as an additive in the polymer, and an implant geometry with large surface area (screw versus pin or rod). For polyglycolic acid implants, the risk of an adverse tissue response in a given clinical situation can be estimated from the findings of this study. For slow degrading polymers like polylactic acid, however, the ultimate biocompatibility still is unsettled, and additional clinical research with long followup is required.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: It is unclear whether the model for end-stage liver disease-sodium (MELD-Na) score captures the clinical severity of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). We compared observed 90-day mortality in patients with ACLF with expected mortality based on the calculated MELD-Na and examined the consequences of underestimating clinical severity. Methods: We identified patients with ACLF during hospitalization for cirrhosis in 127 VA hospitals between 01/01/2004 and 12/31/2014. We examined MELD-Na scores by ACLF presence and grade. We used actual and observed 90-day mortality to estimate a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) by ACLF presence and grade. We used transplant center-specific median MELD-Na at transplantation (MMaT) to estimate the proportion likely to receive priority for liver transplantation (LT) based on MELD-Na alone. Results: Of 71,894 patients hospitalized for decompensated cirrhosis, 18,979 (26.4{\%}) patients met the criteria for ACLF on admission. The median (P25-P75) MELD-Na on admission was 26 (22–30) for ACLF compared to 15 (12–20) for patients without ACLF; it was 24 (21–27), 27 (23–31), and 32 (26–37) for ACLF-1, 2 and 3, respectively. At 90 days, 40.0{\%} of patients with ACLF died (30.8{\%}, 41.6{\%} and 68.8{\%} with ACLF-1, 2 and 3, respectively) compared to 21.3{\%} of patients without ACLF. Compared to the expected death rate based on MELD-Na, mortality risk was higher for patients with ACLF, SMR (95{\%} CI): 1.52 (1.48–1.52), 1.46 (1.41–1.51), 1.50 (1.44–1.55), 1.66 (1.58–1.74) for overall ACLF, ACLF-1, -2 and -3, respectively. Only 9.1{\%} of patients with ACLF reached the national median MELD-Na of 35 and between 17.3{\%} to 35.1{\%} exceeded the MMaT at any center. During index admission, 589 (0.8{\%}) patients with ACLF were considered for LT evaluation and 16 (0.1{\%}) were listed for LT. Conclusions: In a US cohort of hospitalized patients with decompensated cirrhosis, MELD-Na did not capture 90-day mortality risk in patients with ACLF. Patients with ACLF are at a disadvantage in the current MELD-Na-based system. Lay summary: Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a condition marked by multiple organ failures in patients with cirrhosis and is associated with a high risk of death. Liver transplantation may be the only curative treatment for these patients. A score called model for end-stage liver disease-sodium (MELD-Na) helps guide donor liver allocation for transplantation in the United States. The higher the MELD-Na score in a patient, the more likely that a patient receives a liver transplant. Our study data showed that MELD-Na score underestimates the risk of dying at 90 days in patients with ACLF. Thus, physicians need to start liver transplant evaluation early instead of waiting for a high MELD-Na number.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the usage of laryngeal and tracheal stents in the treatment of benign pediatric laryngotracheal disorders, focusing primarily on their role in the management of airway stenosis. RECENT FINDINGS: Little progress has been made in the recent past in the introduction of new laryngeal suprastomal stents in the treatment of laryngeal stenosis. The traditionally available Aboulker stent and Montgomery T-tube remain the workhorse stents used in laryngotracheal reconstructive surgery. Their use and characteristics are reviewed herein. The use of stents as a sole primary treatment of benign tracheal obstruction is limited to short-term symptom palliation, as due to the high rate of complications associated with their usage, their application should be restricted to patients in which formal surgery is contraindicated. SUMMARY: Laryngeal and tracheal stents remain best used primarily as postoperative adjunctive devices to assist in the appropriate healing of reconstructive surgical procedures for benign laryngotracheal stenosis.},

The consequences of cerebral edema can be lethal and include cerebral ischemia from compromised regional or global cerebral blood flow (CBF) and intracranial compartmental shifts due to intracranial pressure gradients that result in compression of vital brain structures. The overall goal of medical management of cerebral edema is to maintain regional and global CBF to meet the metabolic requirements of the brain and prevent secondary neuronal injury from cerebral ischemia. Medical management of cerebral edema involves using a systematic and algorithmic approach, from general measures (optimal head and neck positioning for facilitating intracranial venous outflow, avoidance of dehydration and systemic hypotension, and maintenance of normothermia) to specific therapeutic interventions (controlled hyperventilation, administration of corticosteroids and diuretics, osmotherapy, and pharmacological cerebral metabolic suppression). This article reviews and highlights the medical management of cerebral edema based on pathophysiological principles in acute brain injury.},

abstract = {Introduction: Given increasing numbers of breast cancer survivors, there is an increased focus on quality of life and quality of care. This study aims to investigate whether clinical or patient reported outcomes are most important for perceived quality of care by breast cancer patients. Methods: Overall, 606 patients aged 18 years or older, who underwent breast cancer surgery 9-18 months ago in five hospitals in the Netherlands, were invited to complete an internet-based questionnaire. Patients were asked to judge a random selection of 24 patient profiles and choose which of 2 presented patients had received the best quality of care, using conjoint analysis. The individual relative importance (RI) for each outcome was estimated using Hierarchical Bayes Estimation, and averaged over all patients to assess which outcomes were most important. Results: Complete data were available for 350 patients (58{\%}). Avoiding severe breast symptoms was most important for good quality of care according to patients (RI 23.22 [95{\%} Confidence Interval (95{\%} CI) 22.32-24.12]), followed by a 2 year longer disease free survival (18.30 [17.38-19.22]). However, the importance differed by age: younger patients ({\textless}50 years) assigned higher importance to longer disease free survival (21.99 [19.52-24.46]) than older patients (65 + years) (15.03 [13.88-16.18]). Conclusion: Avoiding severe breast symptoms rather than 2 year longer disease free survival is considered most important in our population of breast cancer patients for evaluation of quality of care. These data should thus be included in both information provision prior to treatment choices and post treatment quality of care evaluation.},

abstract = {The Cox model relies on the proportional hazards (PH) assumption, implying that the factors investigated have a constant impact on the hazard - or risk - over time. We emphasize the importance of this assumption and the misleading conclusions that can be inferred if it is violated; this is particularly essential in the presence of long follow-ups. We illustrate our discussion by analyzing prognostic factors of metastases in 979 women treated for breast cancer with surgery. Age, tumour size and grade, lymph node involvement, peritumoral vascular invasion (PVI), status of hormone receptors (HRec), Her2, and Mib1 were considered. Median follow-up was 14 years; 264 women developed metastases. The conventional Cox model suggested that all factors but HRec, Her2, and Mib1 status were strong prognostic factors of metastases. Additional tests indicated that the PH assumption was not satisfied for some variables of the model. Tumour grade had a significant time-varying effect, but although its effect diminished over time, it remained strong. Interestingly, while the conventional Cox model did not show any significant effect of the HRec status, tests provided strong evidence that this variable had a non-constant effect over time. Negative HRec status increased the risk of metastases early but became protective thereafter. This reversal of effect may explain non-significant hazard ratios provided by previous conventional Cox analyses in studies with long follow-ups. Investigating time-varying effects should be an integral part of Cox survival analyses. Detecting and accounting for time-varying effects provide insights on some specific time patterns, and on valuable biological information that could be missed otherwise.},

abstract = {Organ shortage has driven many transplant centers to extend their criteria for organ acceptance. Graft allocation policies have been modified accordingly. This report focuses on the impact of applying the so-called rescue allocation (RA) strategy for liver transplantation (LT) in a single center within the Eurotransplant (ET) area. Liver grafts are considered for RA when the regular organ allocation is declined by at least three centers or is averted because of donor instability/unfavorable logistical reasons, thus entering a competitive or a single-recipient rescue organ offer procedure, respectively. The accepting center has the advantage to select a recipient from its own waiting list for these RA grafts. Among 253 livers accepted at the University of Heidelberg between January 2004 and December 2006, we transplanted 85 (34{\%}) rescue-allocated livers. The indications for LT were hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, 43{\%}), chronic liver disease (55{\%}), and acute liver failure (2{\%}). Median cold ischemia time for RA grafts was 10 h (range: 4-17). The MELD score (mean +/- SD) was 13 +/- 7 (range: 6-40) and was 12 +/- 7 for recipients with HCC. Three (3.5{\%}) primary non-functions (PNF) occurred after transplantation of RA livers. One-year patient and graft survival were 84{\%} and 75{\%}, respectively. A comparison between the recipients of RA livers and regularly allocated livers revealed no significant difference regarding initial poor function (IPF), PNF, and surgical complications. Furthermore, a median follow-up of 16 months revealed no significant difference regarding patient and graft survival between the two groups. The use of RA organs has increased the donor pool and transplantation dynamics with satisfying results. The unique possibility to match livers with recipients, which is left to the discretion of accepting center, should be judged according to the center's experience to decrease the waiting times for a timely rescue of organs/recipients while avoiding futile transplantations.},

Methods Eleven patients with glottic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) who received CO2 laser cordectomy European Laryngological Society type III-IV with complete datasets at preoperative, immediate postoperative (within 4 months), and delayed (greater than 6 months) time points were included. Results All patients (n = 11) received cordectomy as their primary treatment. Tumor stage was divided evenly between T1 and T2. One patient was referred for post-cordectomy thyroplasty. Mean Voice Handicap Index (VHI) scores increased in the immediate postoperative period (43.3-46.2) but did not reach significance (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Delayed postoperative VHI (23.3) demonstrated substantial improvement from both pre- and immediate postoperative levels (P = 0.047). Objective voice rating significantly declined initially (P = 0.03; Grade, P = 0.01; Breathiness) and recovered to similar preoperative levels. Maximum phonation time (MPT) showed substantial decreases at the initial postoperative period (P = 0.007). Although significant improvement was made at the delayed postoperative point (P = 0.009), MPT remained below the preoperative level (P = 0.028). No significant changes were seen in phonatory subglottic pressures. Conclusions Patients undergoing extended CO2 laser cordectomy for glottic cancers can experience initial decline in voice quality; however, vocal function routinely returns to preoperative levels following the initial healing period. A small percentage of extended cordectomy patients may require further vocal interventions.},

abstract = {Background and Aims: Among patients with cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation, prediction of wait-list (WL) mortality is adjudicated by the Model for End Stage Liver Disease–Sodium (MELD-Na) score. Replacing serum creatinine (SCr) with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in the MELD-Na score may improve prediction of WL mortality, especially for women and highest disease severity. Approach and Results: We developed (2014) and validated (2015) a model incorporating eGFR using national data (n = 17,095) to predict WL mortality. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated using the GFR assessment in liver disease (GRAIL) developed among patients with cirrhosis. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis models were used to compare the predicted 90-day WL mortality between MELD-GRAIL-Na (re-estimated bilirubin, international normalized ratio [INR], sodium, and GRAIL) versus MELD-Na. Within 3 months, 27.8{\%} were transplanted, 4.3{\%} died on the WL, and 4.7{\%} were delisted for other reasons. GFR as estimated by GRAIL (hazard ratio [HR] 0.382, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 0.344-0.424) and the re-estimated model MELD-GRAIL-Na (HR 1.212, 95{\%} CI 1.199-1.224) were significant predictors of mortality or being delisted on the WL within 3 months. MELD-GRAIL-Na was a better predictor of observed mortality at highest deciles of disease severity (≥ 27-40). For a score of 32 or higher (observed mortality 0.68), predicted mortality was 0.67 (MELD-GRAIL-Na) and 0.51 (MELD-Na). For women, a score of 32 or higher (observed mortality 0.67), the predicted mortality was 0.69 (MELD-GRAIL-Na) and 0.55 (MELD-Na). In 2015, use of MELD-GRAIL-Na as compared with MELD-Na resulted in reclassification of 16.7{\%} (n = 672) of patients on the WL.

abstract = {Several epidemiological studies have shown a positive association between adult height and cancer incidence. The only study conducted among women on mouth and pharynx cancer risk, however, reported an inverse association. This study aims to investigate the association between height and the risk of head and neck cancer (HNC) within a large international consortium of HNC. We analyzed pooled individual-level data from 24 case-control studies participating in the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology Consortium. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated separately for men and women for associations between height and HNC risk. Educational level, tobacco smoking, and alcohol consumption were included in all regression models. Stratified analyses by HNC subsites were performed. This project included 17,666 cases and 28,198 controls. We found an inverse association between height and HNC (adjusted OR per 10 cm height = 0.91; 95{\%} CI 5 0.86-0.95 for men; adjusted OR = 0.86; 95{\%} CI 5 0.79-0.93 for women). In men, the estimated OR did vary by educational level, smoking status, geographic area, and control source. No differences by subsites were detected. Adult height is inversely associated with HNC risk. As height can be considered a marker of childhood illness and low energy intake, the inverse association is consistent with prior studies showing that HNC occur more frequently among deprived individuals. Further studies designed to elucidate the mechanism of such association would be warranted.},

Ten of the patients had received full courses of radiation therapy prior to the surgical procedure and had recurrent carcinomas. Other reports have noted that laryngectomy following full courses of "unplanned preoperative" radiation therapy is usually associated with a high incidence of postoperative pharyngeal fistula. The pharyngeal fistula problem, and the pharyngeal repair that was used in our series, are discussed. The pharynx was closed carefully in three layers with fine, absorbable sutures, and a submucosal inverting technique was used for the important mucous membrane closure. Tube feedings were used for two weeks after surgery. A high incidence of pharyngocutaneous fistula after laryngectomy in the irradiated patient can be prevented.},

Twenty young adult men and 20 young adult women were included in this study. Participants produced 10 trials of /s/ and 10 of /z/ with a controlled intensity of 60-dB sound-pressure level (SPL). Maximum prolongations and s/z ratio were determined by three different methods: based on the longest out of 10 trials, the longest of 3 trials, and an average of the first 3 trials. Results revealed that based on averaged group data, /s/ and /z/ seemed to be prolonged for similar durations. Men consistently prolonged both phonemes significantly longer than women. There were no significant differences in s/z ratio between men and women. However, when individual data were reviewed, it seemed that some subjects consistently prolonged /s/ for a longer duration than /z/, some subjects prolonged /z/ longer than /s/, and some subjects actually produced approximately equal durations of the two phonemes. It was further noted that /s/ durations were more favorably impacted by practice than /z/ durations. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Voice Foundation.},

abstract = {Objective: This study aimed to compare the incidence of radiologically unrecognized (occult) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lesions in explant hepatectomy specimens from orthotopic liver transplants (OLTs) performed for HCC with rates of HCC intrahepatic recurrence after resection. Summary of Background Data: Resection of HCC is associated with high rates of intrahepatic HCC recurrence. However, it is unclear whether these recurrences represent incomplete resection of unrecognized metastatic lesions from the primary tumor or subsequent de novo tumor formation due to inherent biological proclivity for HCC formation. Methods: We collected patient, tumor, and pathology data on HCC patients treated surgically from 3696 OLTs in the Organ Procurement and Transplantation (OPTN) national database, 299 OLTs at a single transplant center, and 232 partial hepatectomies from a hepatobiliary cancer center. Results: In the OPTN and high-volume transplant center cohorts, 37{\%} and 42{\%} of patients had occult HCC lesions on explant pathology, respectively. Among cancer center patients, the 2-year recurrence rate was 46{\%}, and 74{\%} of patients who recurred presented with liver only recurrence. Conclusion: Although the transplant and resection populations differ, occult multifocality is common in transplant explants and similar to the 46{\%} early recurrence rate following partial hepatectomy. These data suggest that noncurative resection often results from occult intrahepatic multifocality present at the time of resection rather than a malignant predisposition of the remnant liver with de novo tumorigenesis.},

The unit of analysis was the discharge.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Between 1997 and 2008, the number of laryngectomies done in the United States decreased by 48{\%}. New cases of laryngeal cancer decreased 33{\%} during the same time. The proportion of patients older than 65 years decreased from 48{\%} to 43{\%}. Mortality for the procedure was 1.4{\%} in 1997 and 1.1{\%} in 2008. Mean length of stay over the study period increased from 13 days to 14 days. Mean hospital charges rose from {\$}58,000 in 1997 to {\$}109,000 in 2008, consistent with the overall rise in US health care costs. Medicare was the dominant insurer throughout.

We reviewed retrospectively the records of 108 consecutive patients who underwent a total laryngectomy during the period from December 1992 to December 2002 at the Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland. PCF occurred postoperatively in 19 (18{\%}) patients. Two additional patients (2{\%}) developed a PCF later than 30 days after laryngectomy. Nineteen percent of these patients with fistula formation had received previous radiation therapy and laryngectomy was performed for local recurrence. Eighteen (86{\%}) of the all fistulae closed spontaneously and surgical closure of the fistula was performed in three (14{\%}) cases. We conclude that the PCFs in our patient population occurred both in radiated and nonirradiated patients. Although most fistulae close spontaneously without surgical intervention this complication leads to prolonged hospitalization and increased patient morbidity.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: Patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) can be listed for liver transplantation (LT) because LT is the only curative treatment option. We evaluated whether the clinical course of ACLF, particularly ACLF-3, between the time of listing and LT affects 1-year post-transplant survival. Methods: We identified patients from the United Network for Organ Sharing database who were transplanted within 28 days of listing and categorized them by ACLF grade at waitlist registration and LT, according to the EASL-CLIF definition. Results: A total of 3,636 patients listed with ACLF-3 underwent LT within 28 days. Among those transplanted, 892 (24.5{\%}) recovered to no ACLF or ACLF grade 1 or 2 (ACLF 0–2) and 2,744 (75.5{\%}) had ACLF-3 at transplantation. One-year survival was 82.0{\%} among those transplanted with ACLF-3 vs. 88.2{\%} among those improving to ACLF 0–2 (p {\textless}0.001). Conversely, the survival of patients listed with ACLF 0–2 who progressed to ACLF-3 at LT (n = 2,265) was significantly lower than that of recipients who remained at ACLF 0–2 (n = 17,631) at the time of LT (83.8{\%} vs. 90.2{\%}, p {\textless}0.001). Cox modeling demonstrated that recovery from ACLF-3 to ACLF 0–2 at LT was associated with reduced 1-year mortality after transplantation (hazard ratio 0.65; 95{\%} CI 0.53–0.78). Improvement in circulatory failure, brain failure, and removal from mechanical ventilation were also associated with reduced post-LT mortality. Among patients {\textgreater}60 years of age, 1-year survival was significantly higher among those who improved from ACLF-3 to ACLF 0–2 than among those who did not. Conclusions: Improvement from ACLF-3 at listing to ACLF 0–2 at transplantation enhances post-LT survival, particularly in those who recovered from circulatory or brain failure, or were removed from the mechanical ventilator. The beneficial effect of improved ACLF on post-LT survival was also observed among patients {\textgreater}60 years of age. Lay summary: Liver transplantation (LT) for patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure grade 3 (ACLF-3) significantly improves survival, but 1-year survival probability after LT remains lower than the expected outcomes for transplant centers. Our study reveals that among patients transplanted within 28 days of waitlist registration, improvement of ACLF-3 at listing to a lower grade of ACLF at transplantation significantly enhances post-transplant survival, even among patients aged 60 years or older. Subgroup analysis further demonstrates that improvement in circulatory failure, brain failure, or removal from mechanical ventilation have the strongest impact on post-transplant survival.},

abstract = {Objective: To assess the effects of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) on systemic and renal hemodynamics, neurohumoral factors, and sodium homeostasis in patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites. Design: Prospective study with 1-year follow-up. Setting: Tertiary referral center and university-affiliated hospital. Patients: 7 patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites had metabolic studies done while receiving a 22 mmol/d sodium, 1L/d fluid diet. Intervention: TIPS insertion. Measurements: Urinary sodium excretion, systemic and renal hemodynamics, hormonal profile, and central blood volume were measured before, at day 1 after, and at 1 month after TIPS insertion. Results: Immediately after TIPS insertion, mean corrected sinusoid pressure decreased from 18.2 ± 2.2 mm Hg to 7.7 ± 1.3 mm Hg (P {\textless} 0.001); mean cardiac output increased from 6.83 ± 0.68 L/min to 8.62 L/min (P = 0.005); and mean systemic vascular resistance decreased from 1018 ± 103 dyne {\textperiodcentered} s {\textperiodcentered} cm-5to 762 ± 46 dyne {\textperiodcentered} s {\textperiodcentered} cm-5(p = 0.011). Mean plasma renin activity, serum aldosterone levels, and 24- hour urinary sodium excretion (5.8 ± 0.7 mmol/d before TIPS insertion compared with 6.0 ± 1.8 mmol/d 1 day after insertion) were unchanged; mean elevated plasma norepinephrine levels significantly increased. By 1 month after insertion, mean proximal tubular reabsorption of sodium had decreased, and this had led to a mean natriuresis of 15.1 ± 3.1 mmol/d (P = 0.02 compared with baseline), which was associated with a decrease in plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels to within the normal range. Conclusions: Our results suggest that natriuresis associated with TIPS is delayed and occurs in the presence of increased systemic vasodilatation at 1 month after insertion and that TIPS insertion should not be done in any patients with refractory ascites without careful attention to cardiac and renal status. However, in carefully selected patients, TIPS is a safe and effective means of managing refractory ascites.},

Methods: Review of hospital charts, TLPP was undertaken in 15 of 54 patients. Surgical modalities of reconstruction subsequent to TLPP were indicated on the basis of the width of posterior pharyngeal wall conserved during surgery. Posterior pharyngeal walls of width 3 cm or larger were sutured in primary closure. If the width of posterior wall was less than 3 cm, a free forearm flap or free jejunal flap was patched to the wall. Tracheo-esophageal shunt with a voice prosthesis was performed 3 weeks after surgery. Results: The Kaplan-Meier method indicated no difference in survival rate between patients with TLPP (46.4{\%}) and the remaining patients (47.4{\%}). Nine of 15 patients with TLPP (two patients with primary closure, three with free forearm flap, and four with free jejunal flap) were examined for voice restoration and fluoroscopy of the neopharynx. Eight of the nine patients, in whom more than 2 cm of the posterior pharyngeal wall had been conserved, demonstrated a good speech rating, maximum phonation time and neoglottic formation by the posterior pharyngeal wall. Conclusion: The combination of conservation of the posterior pharyngeal wall, patch graft and a voice prosthesis is a useful method that offers sufficient quality of phonation without deterioration of survival rate for patients with hypopharyngeal cancer. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score is widely used to prioritize patients for liver transplantation. One of the pitfalls of the MELD score is the interlaboratory variability in all three components of the score (INR, bilirubin, creatinine). The interlaboratory variability in the INR has the largest impact on the MELD score, with a mean difference of around 5 MELD points in most studies. During the 3rd conference on Coagulopathy and Liver disease, a multidisciplinary group of scientists and physicians discussed possible solutions for the INR problem in the MELD score with the intention to provide a constructive contribution to the international debate on this issue. Here we will discuss possible solutions and highlight advantages and disadvantages.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims Patients listed with exception points for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been more likely to be transplanted than those listed for chronic liver failure (LF) based on the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. The aim of this study was to determine outcomes in the 5-year experience of a scoring system designed to reflect heterogeneity of tumor load of patients listed for HCC. Methods A novel MELD exception point system based on size and number of HCC was implemented in July 2009. This system allows stratification of patients based on risk of dropping out from the waiting list according to Milan criteria. LF patients were listed according to biological MELD sodium score; HCC patients were reassigned points every three months upon repeat imaging. Results Among 624 patients listed for liver transplant (LT), 505 were eligible. 94 (18.6{\%}) were assigned MELD HCC points. Only 24.7{\%} required changes in allocated points over time. Transplantation rates (HCC 83{\%} vs. LF 73{\%}, p = 0.04) and waiting time in days (HCC 258 vs. LF 325; p = 0.07) were similar. The method of competing risk analysis revealed that HCC patients were more likely to be transplanted than LF during the 5-year period preceding implementation, whereas transplant rates became equivalent for HCC and non-HCC in 2009–2014. One- and two-year survivals were similar between the two groups. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that a novel MELD point system for HCC, taking into account dynamics in tumor size and number, allows for equitable liver allocation without compromising graft and patient survival. Lay summary It has historically been difficult to achieve equitable liver allocation for liver cancer and chronic liver failure with the allocation systems currently in place in many countries worldwide. We designed a new system to help improve access to organs for liver failure patients in Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada. Our 5-year experience demonstrates that this unique system renders access to transplant similar for both liver cancer and liver failure indications.},

abstract = {Background: Antibiotic prophylaxis is frequently administered after liver resection to prevent postoperative infections. However, very few studies have examined the usefulness of antibiotic prophylaxis after liver resection. A randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis in patients after liver resection. Methods: A total of 241 patients scheduled to undergo liver resection were randomly assigned to the non-postoperative antibiotic group (n = 95) or the antibiotic group (n = 95). The antibiotic group was given flomoxef sodium every 12 hours for 3 days after the operation. The end point was signs of infection, surgical site infection, or infectious complications. Results: There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in signs of infection (21.3{\%} vs 25.5{\%}, P =.606), the incidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (11.7{\%} vs 17.0{\%}, P =.406), infectious complications (7.5{\%} vs 17.0{\%}, P =.073), surgical site infection (10.6{\%} vs 13.8{\%}, P =.657), and remote site infection (2.1{\%} vs 8.5{\%}, P =.100). Conclusions: Postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis cannot prevent postoperative infections after liver resection, and it is thought that antibiotic prophylaxis is unnecessary and costly. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Since the introduction of model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) in 2006, post-orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) survival in Germany has declined. The aim of this study was to evaluate risk factors and prognostic scores for outcome. All adult OLT recipients in seven German transplant centers after MELD implementation (December 2006-December 2007) were included. Recipient data were analyzed for their influence on 1-year outcome. A total of 462 patients (mean calculated MELD = 20.5, follow-up: 1 year) were transplanted for alcoholic cirrhosis (33.1{\%}), hepatocellular carcinoma (26.6{\%}), Hepatitis-C (17.1{\%}), Hepatitis-B (9.5{\%}), primary sclerosing cholangitis (5.6{\%}) and late graft-failure after first OLT before December 2006 (8.7{\%}). 1-year patient survival was 75.8{\%} (graft survival 71.2{\%}) correlating with MELD parameters and serum choline esterase. MELD score {\textgreater}30 [odds ratio (OR) = 4.17, confidence interval: 2.57-6.78, 12-month survival = 52.6{\%}, c-statistic = 0.669], hyponatremia (OR = 2.07), and pre-OLT hemodialysis (OR = 2.35) were the main death risk factors. In alcoholic cirrhosis (n = 153, mean MELD = 21.1) and hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 123, mean MELD = 13.5), serum bilirubin and the survival after liver transplantation score were independent outcome parameters, respectively. MELD {\textgreater}30 currently represents a major risk factor for outcome. Risk factors differ in individual patient subgroups. In the current German practice of organ allocation to sicker patients, outcome prediction should be considered to prevent results below acceptable standards.},

abstract = {We propose semiparametric methods for estimating the effect of a time-dependent covariate on treatment-free survival. The data structure of interest consists of a longitudinal sequence of measurements and a potentially censored survival time. The factor of interest is time-dependent. Treatment-free survival is of interest and is dependently censored by the receipt of treatment. Patients may be removed from consideration for treatment, temporarily or permanently. The proposed methods combine landmark analysis and partly conditional hazard regression. A set of calendar time cross-sections is specified, and survival time (from cross-section date) is modeled through weighted Cox regression. The assumed model for death is marginal in the sense that time-varying covariates are taken as fixed at each landmark, with the mortality hazard function implicitly averaging across future covariate trajectories. Dependent censoring is overcome by a variant of inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW). The proposed estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal, with consistent covariance estimators provided. Simulation studies reveal that the proposed estimation procedures are appropriate for practical use. We apply the proposed methods to pre-transplant mortality among end-stage liver disease (ESLD) patients. {\textcopyright} 2013, The International Biometric Society.},

abstract = {Hyponatremia is frequently seen in patients with ascites secondary to advanced cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Although not apparent in the early stages of cirrhosis, the progression of cirrhosis and portal hypertension leads to splanchnic vasodilation, and this leads to the activation of compensatory mechanisms such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), sympathetic nervous system, and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) to ameliorate low circulatory volume. The net effect is the avid retention of sodium and water to compensate for the low effective circulatory volume, resulting in the development of ascites. These compensatory mechanisms lead to impairment of the kidneys to eliminate solute-free water in decompensated cirrhosis. Nonosmotic secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as arginine vasopressin, further worsens excess water retention and thereby hyponatremia. The management of hyponatremia in this setting is a challenge as conventional therapies for hyponatremia including fluid restriction and correction of hypokalemia are frequently inefficacious. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiology, complications, and various treatment modalities, including albumin infusion, selective vasopressin receptor antagonists, or hypertonic saline for patients with severe hyponatremia and those awaiting liver transplantation.},

In patients with early or moderately advanced supraglottic carcinoma, laser microsurgery is comparable to open supraglottic laryngectomy in terms of local control and survival. With regard to organ preservation, laser microsurgery is comparable to open supraglottic laryngectomy but superior to radiotherapy.

This committee reviewed the literature and formulated$\backslash$nstatements and recommendations based on the level of evidence and$\backslash$nconsistency of the literature data. Where reliable literature data were$\backslash$nnot available, recommendations were based on expert opinion.$\backslash$nResults: Strict criteria have been proposed for the radiological$\backslash$ndiagnostic procedures as well as for the pathology report. For carcinoma$\backslash$nin situ and severe dysplasia, microsurgery, preferably by laser, is$\backslash$nproposed. For all other stages of invasive carcinoma, a full course of$\backslash$nradiotherapy as a voice conserving therapy is the treatment of choice.$\backslash$nOnly in cases with massive tumor volumes with invasion through the$\backslash$nlaryngeal skeleton, primary surgery is inevitable. For rehabilitation$\backslash$nand supportive care, minimal criteria are described. Due to the$\backslash$ncomplexity of therapy and relative rarity of larynx carcinoma, all$\backslash$npatients should be seen at least once in a dedicated head and neck$\backslash$nclinic.$\backslash$nConclusion: This guideline for the management of larynx carcinoma was$\backslash$nproduced by a multidisciplinary national committee and based on$\backslash$nscientific evidence wherever possible.

abstract = {This review focuses on pathophysiology, clinical signs, and imaging of brain edema associated with intracranial tumors and its treatment. Brain edema in brain tumors is the result of leakage of plasma into the parenchyma through dysfunctional cerebral capillaries. The latter type of edema (ie, vasogenic edema) and the role of other types in brain tumors is discussed. Vascular endothelial growth factor-induced dysfunction of tight junction proteins probably plays an important role in the formation of edema. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment of brain edema. When possible, corticosteroids should be used in a low dose (eg, 4 mg dexamethasone daily) to avoid serious side effects such as myopathy or diabetes. Higher doses of dexamethasone (16 mg/day or more), sometimes together with osmotherapy (mannitol, glycerol) or surgery, may be used in emergency situations. On tapering, one should be aware of the possible development of corticosteroid dependency or withdrawal effects.Novel therapies include vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitors and corticotropin releasing factor, which should undergo further clinical testing before they can be recommended in practice.},

abstract = {Background Sex-based disparities in liver transplantation (LT) are incompletely understood. We assessed the role of height, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), MELD-Na, and exception points in the disparate access to LT. Methods Adults waitlisted for LT at Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network between 2002 and 2013 were included. Covariates associated with likelihood of LT were analyzed by Cox proportional model. In a separate cohort of waitlisted adults with glomerular filtration rate measurement by iothalamate clearance (n = 611), we determined the number of creatinine-derived MELD points in men versus women, across all ranges of glomerular filtration rate. The impact of correcting the MELD score deficit in women on LT was modeled. Results Among 90 720 Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network registrants, women had higher mortality than men (4 years after listing: 22{\%} vs 18{\%}, P {\textless} 0.0001), and lower likelihood of LT (49{\%} vs 58{\%}, P {\textless} 0.0001); women were 20{\%} less likely to be transplanted (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.78-0.81). Differences in height and MELD exception scores accounted for most of the LT deficit in women (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.89-0.94). Women received between 1 and 2.4 fewer creatinine-derived MELD points than men with similar renal dysfunction. MELD-Na worsened the gender disparity. Addition of 1 or 2 MELD points to women significantly impacted LT access. Conclusions Differences in height and MELD exception points explained most of the sex-based disparity in LT. Additionally, MELD score underestimated disease severity in women by up to 2.4 points and MELD Na exacerbated this disparity. The degree of underestimation based on MELD had significant impact on allocation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple reconstructive procedures are common for the reconstruction of complex facial deformities of skin, soft tissues, bony structures, and functional subunits, such as the nose, lips, and eyelids. However, the results have been unsatisfactory. An innovative approach entailing a single surgical procedure of face allograft transplantation is a viable alternative and gives improved results. METHODS: On Dec 9, 2008, a 45-year-old woman with a history of severe midface trauma underwent near-total face transplantation in which 80{\%} of her face was replaced with a tailored composite tissue allograft. We addressed issues of immunosuppressive therapy, psychological and ethical outcomes, and re-integration of the patient into society. FINDINGS: After the operation, the patient did well physically and psychologically, and tolerated immunosuppression without any major complication. Routine biopsy on day 47 after transplantation showed rejection of graft mucosa; however, a single bolus of corticosteroids reversed rejection. During the first 3 weeks after transplantation, the patient accepted her new face; 6 months after surgery, the functional outcome has been excellent. In contrast to her status before transplantation, the patient can now breathe through her nose, smell, taste, speak intelligibly, eat solid foods, and drink from a cup. INTERPRETATION: We show the feasibility of reconstruction of severely disfigured patients in a single surgical procedure using composite face allotransplantation. Therefore, this should be taken in consideration as an early option for severely disfigured patients. FUNDING: None.},

In a few of the studies, surgical site infection (SSI) rates are mentioned and none of the studies emphasize the effect of decreased surgical time on postoperative cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications. In this study, the authors compared the PCF rates, SSI rates, operation times between 30 mechanical stapler and 40 manual esophageal closure during total laryngectomy for laryngeal cancer patients. National Nasocomial Infections Surveillance system (NNISS) scores were recorded and compared between groups. Total laryngectomy and total operation times were lower in the stapler group patients (P {\textless} 0.001 for total laryngectomy time, P = 0.024 for total operation time). There were lower rates of pharyngocutaneous fistula (P = 0.032), surgical site infection (P = 0.019), and NNISS scores (P = 0.009) in the stapler group. There was no statistically significant difference between groups regarding postoperative systemic complications (P = 0.451). In conclusion, stapler esophageal closure decreases operation time, PCF, SSI rates, and NNISS scores but not the systemic complication rates. Comorbid illnesses and prolonged surgical time are risk factors for postoperative systemic complications in total laryngectomy patients, but patients with additional illnesses must not encourage the surgeon to use stapler for decreasing postoperative systemic complications.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved. Background When a deceased-donor kidney is offered to a waitlisted candidate, the decision to accept or decline the organ relies primarily upon a practitioner's experience and intuition. Such decisions must achieve a delicate balance between estimating the immediate benefit of transplantation and the potential for future higher-quality offers. However, the current experience-based paradigm lacks scientific rigor and is subject to the inaccuracies that plague anecdotal decision-making. Methods A data-driven analytics-based model was developed to predict whether a patient will receive an offer for a deceased-donor kidney at Kidney Donor Profile Index thresholds of 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6, and at timeframes of 3, 6, and 12 months. The model accounted for Organ Procurement Organization, blood group, wait time, DR antigens, and prior offer history to provide accurate and personalized predictions. Performance was evaluated on data sets spanning various lengths of time to understand the adaptability of the method. Results Using United Network for Organ Sharing match-run data from March 2007 to June 2013, out-of-sample area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was approximately 0.87 for all Kidney Donor Profile Index thresholds and timeframes considered for the 10 most populous Organ Procurement Organizations. As more data becomes available, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values increase and subsequently level off. Conclusions The development of a data-driven analytics-based model may assist transplant practitioners and candidates during the complex decision of whether to accept or forgo a current kidney offer in anticipation of a future high-quality offer. The latter holds promise to facilitate timely transplantation and optimize the efficiency of allocation.},

Study Design: Case series with chart review in a tertiary care medical center in Taiwan. Methods: Forty-two consecutive patients who received radiation therapy (RT) or transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) for early glottic cancer over 12 months were evaluated for voice laboratory data and quality-of-life measurements. Results: Twenty-four patients received RT, and 18 underwent TLM. There was no difference between the two groups on acoustic and aerodynamic voice measures except for modal fundamental frequency in males. In the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Head and Neck survey, the TLM group had better communication than the RT group, but there were no differences in voice quality and strength. There was also no significant difference in the Voice Handicap Index 10 evaluation. Conclusions: Male patients who received TLM have higher modal fundamental frequency than male patients who received RT and norms. Voice-related life quality is similar in patients regardless of RT or TLM treatment for early glottic cancer, but those who receive TLM have better communication abilities than those who receive RT. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Voice Foundation.},

abstract = {The disparity between the demand for and supply of donor livers has continued to grow over the last 2 decades, and this has placed greater weight on the need for efficient and effective liver allocation. Although the use of extended criteria donors has shown great potential, it remains unregulated. A survival benefit–based model was recently proposed to answer calls to increase efficiency and reduce futile transplants. However, it was previously determined that the current allocation system was not in need of modification and that instead geographic disparities should be addressed. In contrast, we believe that there is a significant need to replace the current allocation system and complement efforts to improve donor liver distri- bution. We illustrate this need first by identifying major ethical concerns shaping liver allocation and then by using these concerns to identify strengths and shortcomings of the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease/Pediatric End-Stage Liver Dis- ease system and a survival benefit–based model. The latter model is a promising means of improving liver allocation: it incorporates a greater number of ethical principles, uses a sophisticated statistical model to increase efficiency and reduce waste, minimizes bias, and parallels developments in the allocation of other organs. However, it remains limited in its post- transplant predictive accuracy and may raise potential issues regarding informed consent. In addition, the proposed model fails to include quality-of-life concerns and prioritize younger patients. We feel that it is time to take the next steps toward better liver allocation not only through reductions in geographic disparities but also through the adoption of a model better equipped to balance the many ethical concerns shaping organ allocation. Thus, we support the development of a similar model with suggested amendments.},

However, published experience with primary CO2 laser cordectomy specifically for glottic SCC involving the anterior commissure (AC) is limited. A review of single academic institution experience with CO2 laser cordectomy for glottic SCC involving the AC. Patients undergoing European Laryngological Society (ELS) classification cordectomy type Va or type VI between 2005 and 2013 were included. Post-surgical voice analysis was performed by speech language pathologists (SLP) from the reporting institution. Thirty patients were identified for inclusion. Mean post-surgical follow-up time was 47.6 months (range 11-59). Initial local recurrence was identified in 5/30 (16.7{\%}) patients. 2/5 recurrences were successfully salvaged by repeat CO2 laser resections, 2/5 ultimately required salvage total laryngectomy, and 1/5 patient developed a second primary preventing further curative treatment. Overall laryngeal preservation rate was 28/30 (93.3{\%}). Overall survival of the study cohort was 96.7{\%}. Mean postoperative voice handicap index-120 score was 36.9 (SD = 21.4). Perceptual analysis performed on the GRBAS scale resulted in mean scores: G = 2.1 (SD = 0.9), R = 1.3 (SD = 1.1), B = 1.6 (SD = 1.2). Though cancers involving the AC represent an aggressive subgroup of glottic SCC, CO2 laser cordectomy results in encouraging oncologic and voice outcomes without the need for further therapy in the majority of cases. Clinical trials are encouraged to further define optimal treatment recommendations for glottic SCC involving the AC.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Survival has decreased among patients with laryngeal cancer during the past 2 decades in the United States. During this same period, there has been an increase in the nonsurgical treatment of laryngeal cancer. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to identify trends in the demographics, management, and outcome of laryngeal cancer in the United States and to analyze factors contributing to the decreased survival. STUDY DESIGN: The authors conducted a retrospective, longitudinal study of laryngeal cancer cases. METHODS: Review of the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) revealed 158,426 cases of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (excluding verrucous carcinoma) diagnosed between the years 1985 and 2001. Analysis of these case records addressed demographics, management, and survival for cases grouped according to stage, site, and specific TNM classifications. RESULTS: This review of data from the NCDB analysis confirms the previously identified trend toward decreasing survival among patients with laryngeal cancer from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s. Patterns of initial management across this same period indicated an increase in the use of chemoradiation with a decrease in the use of surgery despite an increase in the use of endoscopic resection. The most notable decline in the 5-year relative survival between the 1985 to 1990 period and the 1994 to 1996 period occurred among advanced-stage glottic cancer, early-stage supraglottic cancers, and supraglottic cancers classified as T3N0M0. Initial treatment of T3N0M0 laryngeal cancer (all sites) in the 1994 to 1996 period resulted in poor 5-year relative survival for those receiving either chemoradiation (59.2{\%}) or irradiation alone (42.7{\%}) when compared with that of patients after surgery with irradiation (65.2{\%}) and surgery alone (63.3{\%}). In contrast, identical 5-year relative survival (65.6{\%}) rates were observed during this same period for the subset of T3N0M0 glottic cancers initially treated with either chemoradiation or surgery with irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: The decreased survival recorded for patients with laryngeal cancer in the mid-1990s may be related to changes in patterns of management. Future studies are warranted to further evaluate these associations.},

Postoperative airway obstruction that necessitates emergent tracheotomy is an important complication in arytenoid adduction patients when the standard posterior thyroplasty window is used to approach the posterolateral larynx. Immediate postoperative fiberoptic laryngoscopy shows ipsilateral edema and/or hematoma of the arytenoid and supraglottic mucosa, with occasional obstructing inspiratory collapse. In this study, I sought to modify the posterior window approach during arytenoid adduction surgery, and thereby decrease the incidence of immediate postoperative airway obstruction. METHODS: I performed a retrospective chart review of 246 arytenoid adduction patients, looking for immediate postoperative airway compromise. RESULTS: There were no episodes of postoperative airway obstruction that necessitated tracheotomy in the first 30 patients in whom I approached the posterolateral larynx using the classic Isshiki techniques. Nine of the succeeding 132 adduction patients required emergent tracheotomy when the standard posterior window technique was used instead of a classic Isshiki approach (6.8{\%}). In the most recent 84 patients, I used one tacking suture to stabilize the elevated pyriform sinus mucosa to the upper margin of the posterior window cartilage at closure. Four of the 84 patients had audible postoperative airway turbulence that abated with medical treatment, and 1 patient required an emergent tracheotomy (1.2{\%}; p = .0495). CONCLUSIONS: Suture stabilization of the pyriform sinus mucosa is effective and is recommended for prevention of posterior glottic airway obstruction after arytenoid adduction when the posterior window technique is used.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the use of resection and postoperative radiotherapy, high-risk squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck frequently recurs in the original tumor bed. We tested the hypothesis that concurrent postoperative administration of cisplatin and radiotherapy would improve the rate of local and regional control. METHODS: Between September 9, 1995, and April 28, 2000, 459 patients were enrolled. After undergoing total resection of all visible and palpable disease, 231 patients were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy alone (60 to 66 Gy in 30 to 33 fractions over a period of 6 to 6.6 weeks) and 228 patients to receive the identical treatment plus concurrent cisplatin (100 mg per square meter of body-surface area intravenously on days 1, 22, and 43). RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 45.9 months, the rate of local and regional control was significantly higher in the combined-therapy group than in the group given radiotherapy alone (hazard ratio for local or regional recurrence, 0.61; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.41 to 0.91; P=0.01). The estimated two-year rate of local and regional control was 82 percent in the combined-therapy group, as compared with 72 percent in the radiotherapy group. Disease-free survival was significantly longer in the combined-therapy group than in the radiotherapy group (hazard ratio for disease or death, 0.78; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.61 to 0.99; P=0.04), but overall survival was not (hazard ratio for death, 0.84; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.65 to 1.09; P=0.19). The incidence of acute adverse effects of grade 3 or greater was 34 percent in the radiotherapy group and 77 percent in the combined-therapy group (P{\textless}0.001). Four patients who received combined therapy died as a direct result of the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Among high-risk patients with resected head and neck cancer, concurrent postoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy significantly improve the rates of local and regional control and disease-free survival. However, the combined treatment is associated with a substantial increase in adverse effects.},

abstract = {Whole brain radiotherapy (RT) is frequently used to palliate symptoms in patients with brain metastases, but the palliative benefit to patients has not been well documented. We conducted a longitudinal observational prospective study of patients receiving standard RT (20 Gray (Gy)/5 fractions) for symptomatic brain metastases. End-points were observer rating of neurological symptoms, patient-rated symptoms, performance status, neurological functional status, cognitive function and quality of life (QOL). Median survival for the 75 patients was 86 days (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 65-101 days). At 1 month, 19{\%} of patients showed an improvement or resolution of presenting symptoms, 23{\%} were stable and 55{\%} had progressed or died. Patient-rated symptoms were increased at 1 month in comparison to baseline data. Only 4 patients had an improved performance status and 22 were stable. Many patients with brain metastases have a short life expectancy and may not benefit from even short duration radiation schedules. Further effort is needed to optimise patient selection and tailor treatment appropriately. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: Acute decompensation (AD) of cirrhosis is defined as the acute development of ascites, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hepatic encephalopathy, infection or any combination thereof, requiring hospitalization. The presence of organ failure(s) in patients with AD defines acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). The PREDICT study is a European, prospective, observational study, designed to characterize the clinical course of AD and to identify predictors of ACLF. Methods: A total of 1,071 patients with AD were enrolled. We collected detailed pre-specified information on the 3-month period prior to enrollment, and clinical and laboratory data at enrollment. Patients were then closely followed up for 3 months. Outcomes (liver transplantation and death) at 1 year were also recorded. Results: Three groups of patients were identified. Pre-ACLF patients (n = 218) developed ACLF and had 3-month and 1-year mortality rates of 53.7{\%} and 67.4{\%}, respectively. Unstable decompensated cirrhosis (UDC) patients (n = 233) required ≥1 readmission but did not develop ACLF and had mortality rates of 21.0{\%} and 35.6{\%}, respectively. Stable decompensated cirrhosis (SDC) patients (n = 620) were not readmitted, did not develop ACLF and had a 1-year mortality rate of only 9.5{\%}. The 3 groups differed significantly regarding the grade and course of systemic inflammation (high-grade at enrollment with aggravation during follow-up in pre-ACLF; low-grade at enrollment with subsequent steady-course in UDC; and low-grade at enrollment with subsequent improvement in SDC) and the prevalence of surrogates of severe portal hypertension throughout the study (high in UDC vs. low in pre-ACLF and SDC). Conclusions: Acute decompensation without ACLF is a heterogeneous condition with 3 different clinical courses and 2 major pathophysiological mechanisms: systemic inflammation and portal hypertension. Predicting the development of ACLF remains a major future challenge. ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT03056612. Lay summary: Herein, we describe, for the first time, 3 different clinical courses of acute decompensation (AD) of cirrhosis after hospital admission. The first clinical course includes patients who develop acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) and have a high short-term risk of death – termed pre-ACLF. The second clinical course (unstable decompensated cirrhosis) includes patients requiring frequent hospitalizations unrelated to ACLF and is associated with a lower mortality risk than pre-ACLF. Finally, the third clinical course (stable decompensated cirrhosis), includes two-thirds of all patients admitted to hospital with AD – patients in this group rarely require hospital admission and have a much lower 1-year mortality risk.},

METHODS: We have prospectively evaluated patients treated with TOLM for Tis, T1 or T2 glottic squamous cell carcinoma. Evaluation of oncological outcomes, and voice and functional outcomes was assessed using voice-handicap index 10 (VHI-10) and performance status scale for head {\&} neck cancer patients (PSS-H{\&}N). Predictors of poor voice quality were evaluated using Student's t-test. RESULTS: Thirty patients were included, with 17.7 months mean follow-up. There were no cases of locoregional recurrence. Twelve patients (40{\%}) were considered as having a problematic voice outcome. Four subjects out of 30 (13.3{\%}) had significant problems with understandability of speech. Significant differences (P {\textless} 0.05) in VHI-10 score were found with tumor stage and partial resection of the ventricular fold.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) has been used as a prognostic tool since 2002 to predict pre-transplant mortality. Increasing proportions of transplant candidates with higher MELD scores, combined with improvements in transplant outcomes, mandate the need to study surgical outcomes in patients with MELD scores of {\textgreater}/=40. METHODS: A retrospective longitudinal analysis of United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) data on all liver transplantations performed between February 2002 and June 2011 (n = 33 398) stratified by MELD score ({\textless}30, 30-39, {\textgreater}/=40) was conducted. The primary outcomes of interest were short- and longterm graft and patient survival. A Kaplan-Meier product limit method and Cox regression were used. A subanalysis using a futile population was performed to determine futility predictors. RESULTS: Of the 33 398 transplant recipients analysed, 74{\%} scored {\textless}30, 18{\%} scored 30-39, and 8{\%} scored {\textgreater}/=40 at transplantation. Recipients with MELD scores of {\textgreater}/=40 were more likely to be younger (P {\textless} 0.001), non-White and to have shorter waitlist times (P {\textless} 0.001). Overall patient survival correlated inversely with increasing MELD score; this trend was consistent for both short-term (30 days and 90 days) and longterm (1, 3 and 5 years) graft and patient survival. In multivariate analysis, increasing age, African-American ethnicity, donor obesity and diabetes were negative predictors of survival. Futility predictors included patient age of {\textgreater}60 years, obesity, peri-transplantation intensive care unit hospitalization with ventilation, and multiple comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplantation in recipients with MELD scores of {\textgreater}/=40 offers acceptable longterm survival outcomes. Futility predictors indicate the need for prospective follow-up studies to define the population to gain the highest benefit from this precious resource.},

abstract = {Despite the adoption of "sickest first" liver transplantation, pretransplant death remains common, and many early deaths occur despite initially low Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores. From 1997-2003, we studied 507 cirrhotic United States veterans referred for consideration of liver transplantation to identify additional predictors of early mortality. Most of the patients were male (98{\%}) with cirrhosis caused by hepatitis C and/or alcohol (88{\%}). Data for 296 patients referred prior to February 27, 2002 (training group), were analyzed; findings were validated in 211 patients referred subsequently (validation group). In the training group, 61 patients (21{\%}) died within 180 days without transplantation; their median initial MELD score was 21. MELD score, persistent ascites, and low serum sodium ({\textless}135 meq/L) were independent predictors of early mortality. In patients with a MELD score of less than 21, only low serum sodium and persistent ascites were independent predictors of mortality; for MELD scores above 21, only MELD was independently predictive. Prognostic significance of persistent ascites and low serum sodium for low MELD score patients was confirmed in the validation group. Risk varied continuously with worsening hyponatremia. Modifying MELD, by including points for persistent ascites and low serum sodium, improved prediction of early pretransplant mortality in low MELD score patients. In conclusion, persistent ascites and low serum sodium identify patients with cirrhosis with high mortality risk despite low MELD scores. Ascites, hyponatremia, and other findings indicative of hemodynamic decompensation merit further prospective study as prognostic indicators in patients awaiting liver transplantation, and should be considered in setting minimal listing criteria.},

The complication rates for total laryngectomy (63 patients) and extended laryngectomy (37 patients) were 19{\%} and 49{\%}, respectively, while the fistula rates were 8{\%} and 27{\%}, respectively. These rates were influenced primarily by the extent of surgery and the type of reconstruction, which during this interval included primary closure, pectoralis major myocutaneous flap, or gastric transposition. In comparison to our previous study, when the deltopectoral flap was used for patching the pharynx, the fistula rate for extended laryngectomy has decreased as a result of our use of myocutaneous flaps and greater experience with gastric transposition. Currently, we use the pectoralis major myocutaneous flap for pharyngeal repair if the mucosa would otherwise be closed under tension. All circumferential defects are repaired with a gastric transposition.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: Liver transplantation (LT) has been proposed as an effective salvage therapy even for the sickest patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). This large collaborative study was designed to assess the current clinical practice and outcomes of patients with ACLF who are wait-listed for LT in Europe. Methods: This was a retrospective study including 308 consecutive patients with ACLF, listed in 20 centres across 8 European countries, from January 2018 to June 2019. Results: A total of 2,677 patients received a LT: 1,216 (45.4{\%}) for decompensated cirrhosis. Of these, 234 (19.2{\%}) had ACLF at LT: 58 (4.8{\%}) had ACLF-1, 78 (6.4{\%}) had ACLF-2, and 98 (8.1{\%}) had ACLF-3. Wide variations were observed amongst countries: France and Germany had high rates of ACLF-2/3 (27–41{\%}); Italy, Switzerland, Poland and the Netherlands had medium rates (9–15{\%}); and the United Kingdom and Spain had low rates (3–5{\%}) (p {\textless}0.0001). The 1-year probability of survival after LT for patients with ACLF was 81{\%} (95{\%} CI 74–87). Pre-LT arterial lactate levels {\textgreater}4 mmol/L (hazard ratio [HR] 3.14; 95{\%} CI 1.37–7.19), recent infection from multidrug resistant organisms (HR 3.67; 95{\%} CI 1.63–8.28), and renal replacement therapy (HR 2.74; 95{\%} CI 1.37–5.51) were independent predictors of post-LT mortality. During the same period, 74 patients with ACLF died on the waiting list. In an intention-to-treat analysis, 1-year survival of patients with ACLF on the LT waiting list was 73{\%} for ACLF-1 or -2 and 50{\%} for ACLF-3. Conclusion: The results reveal wide variations in the listing of patients with ACLF in Europe despite favourable post-LT survival. Risk factors for mortality were identified, enabling a more precise prognostic assessment of patients with ACLF. Lay summary: Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a severe clinical condition for which liver transplantation is an effective therapeutic option. This study has demonstrated that in Europe, referral and access to liver transplantation (LT) for patients with ACLF needs to be harmonised to avoid inequities. Post-LT survival for patients with ACLF was {\textgreater}80{\%} after 1 year and some factors have been identified to help select patients with favourable outcomes.},

abstract = {Patients with herpes zoster oticus (HZO) may commonly show symptoms associated with 7th and 8th cranial nerve (CN VII and CN VIII) dysfunction. The aim of this study is to investigate the characteristics of hearing loss in patients with HZO and discuss possible mechanisms.Ninety-five HZO patients who showed at least one of the symptoms of CN VII and CN VIII dysfunction between January 2007 and October 2014 were included in this study. Hearing loss was defined when the mean thresholds of pure tone audiometry (PTA) in speech frequency (0.5 kHz + 1 kHz + 2 kHz/3) or isolated high frequency (4 kHz + 8 kHz/2) were greater than 10 dB in the affected ear compared with the healthy ear, and a total of 72 patients were classified as the hearing loss group.The difference of mean PTA thresholds between affected and healthy ears was significantly greater in the high frequency range than in low range (20.0 +/- 11.5 dB vs. 12.9 +/- 15.7 dB, P = 0.0026) in patients with hearing loss (n = 72). The difference between affected and healthy ear was significantly greater in patients with vertigo (n = 34) than those without vertigo (n = 38) in both the high (P = 0.033) and low (P = 0.024) frequency ranges. In contrast, the differences between affected and healthy ears were not significantly different between patients with facial palsy (n = 50) and those without facial palsy (n = 22) in both the high (P = 0.921) and low (P = 0.382) frequency ranges.In patients with HZO, hearing loss is more severe in the high frequency range than in the low frequency range. Hearing impairment is more severe in patients with vertigo than in those without vertigo in both the high and low frequency ranges, even though the degree of hearing impairment is not significantly different between patients with and without facial palsy. These findings indicate that the mechanisms of viral spread from CN VII to CN VIII may differ between vestibular and audiologic deficits.},

abstract = {The objective of the study was to determine maximum phonation time reliability as a function of the number of trials, days, and raters in dysphonic and control subjects. Two groups of adult subjects participated in this reliability study: a group of outpatients with functional or organic dysphonia versus a group of healthy control subjects matched by age and gender. Over a period of maximally 6 weeks, three video recordings were made of five subjects' maximum phonation time trials. A panel of five experts were responsible for all measurements, including a repeated measurement of the subjects' first recordings. Patients showed significantly shorter maximum phonation times compared with healthy controls (on average, 6.6 seconds shorter). The averaged interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) over all raters per trial for the first day was 0.998. The averaged reliability coefficient per rater and per trial for repeated measurements of the first day's data was 0.997, indicating high intrarater reliability. The mean reliability coefficient per day for one trial was 0.939. When using five trials, the reliability increased to 0.987. The reliability over five trials for a single day was 0.836; for 2 days, 0.911; and for 3 days, 0.935. To conclude, the maximum phonation time has proven to be a highly reliable measure in voice assessment. A single rater is sufficient to provide highly reliable measurements. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Voice Foundation.},

abstract = {Hyponatremia in cirrhosis is defined as a serum sodium level ≤130 mEq/L and occurs in approximately 22{\%} of patients with cirrhosis. The appearance of hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis portends a poor prognosis before liver transplantation (LT), independent of the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. With the development of the MELD-sodium score, the management of hyponatremia has become more relevant than ever before. Overcorrection of hyponatremia before LT or perioperatively can lead to the devastating neurologic condition known as osmotic demyelination syndrome, which is often irreversible and fatal. Therefore, the most important tenet of hyponatremia is to avoid correcting the serum sodium by ≥8 mEq/L in a 24-hour period. Treatment of hyponatremia is highly challenging. The vast majority of patients with cirrhosis have chronic hypervolemic hyponatremia. Fluid restriction increases serum sodium levels, but tolerance and compliance are significant barriers. Diuretic withdrawal is helpful but contributes to worsening fluid overload. There are limited data to support use of intravenous concentrated albumin solutions. The use of the arginine vasopressin antagonists (“vaptans”) is contentious; however, they may have a limited role. Risk factors for intraoperative overcorrection of serum sodium include increased utilization of packed red blood cell and fresh frozen plasma transfusions, which are often unavoidable. Intraoperative management is evolving, and more data are needed in regard to the use of sodium-reduced continuous venovenous hemofiltration and the use of trishydroxymethylaminomethane (Tris) to avoid excess sodium rebound. A thorough discussion of the current treatment options before and during LT is given in this review.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Phonation threshold pressure (PTP) and phonation threshold flow (PTF) are useful aerodynamic parameters, but each is sensitive to different disorders. A single comprehensive aerodynamic parameter sensitive to a variety of disorders might be beneficial in quantitative voice assessment. We performed the first study of phonation threshold power (PTW) in human subjects. METHODS: PTP and PTF were measured in 100 normal subjects, 19 subjects with vocal fold immobility, and 94 subjects with a benign mass lesion. PTW was calculated from these two parameters. In 41 subjects with a polyp, measurements were obtained before and after excision. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to determine the ability of the three parameters to distinguish between controls and disordered groups. RESULTS: The PTW (p {\textless} 0.001), PTP (p {\textless} 0.001), and PTF (p {\textless} 0.001) were different among the three groups. All parameters decreased after polyp excision. PTW had the highest area under the ROC curve for all analyses. CONCLUSIONS: PTW is sensitive to the presence of mass lesions and vocal fold mobility disorders. Additionally, changes in PTW can be observed after excision of mass lesions. PTW could be a useful parameter to describe the aerodynamic inputs to voice production.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Improve the care of acute external laryngeal trauma by reviewing controversies and the evolution of treatment. DATA SOURCE: Internet-based search engines, civilian and military databases, and manual search of references from these sources over the past 90 years. REVIEW METHODS: Utilizing the above-mentioned sources, electronic and manual searches of primary topics such as laryngeal trauma or injury, emergency tracheotomy, airway trauma, intubation versus tracheotomy, cricothyrotomy, esophageal trauma, and emergent management of airway injuries in civilian and combat zones. Citations were reviewed, selected reports analyzed, and the most relevant articles referenced. RESULTS: Optimal treatment of acute laryngeal trauma includes early identification of injuries utilizing a directed history and physical examination. Timely management of the wounded airway is essential. The choice of intubation, tracheotomy, or cricothyrotomy must be individualized. Computed tomography (CT) may assist in differentiating patients who can be observed versus those who require surgical exploration. In selected patients, laryngeal electromyography and stroboscopy may also be useful. Surgery should begin with direct laryngoscopy and rigid esophagoscopy to evaluate the hard and soft tissues of the larynx, and to visualize the pharynx and esophagus. Minor endolaryngeal lacerations and abrasions may be observed, whereas more significant injuries require primary closure via a thyrotomy. Laryngeal skeletal fractures should be reduced and fixated. Endolaryngeal stenting is reversed for massive mucosal trauma, comminuted fractures, and traumatic anterior commissure disruption. CONCLUSIONS: Acute external injury to the larynx is both life threatening and a potential long-term management challenge. Although a rare injury, sufficient experience now exists to recommend specific treatments, and to preserve voice and airway function.},

abstract = {Objectives/Hypothesis Laryngeal cancer and its treatment, despite management with organ-preservation treatments, is known to negatively affect voice and functional outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine whether functional outcomes and patient perceptions were improved by combining organ preservation with post treatment function rehabilitation. Study Design Randomized controlled trial. Method Sixty-one patients with carcinoma in situ (Tis) to T4 size laryngeal cancers treated with radiotherapy were prospectively recruited. Thirty patients were randomized into the voice rehabilitation (VR) group and 31 received no VR (control group). The VR group underwent 10 speech pathology sessions postradiotherapy. Voice function was evaluated pre-VR and at 6 and 12 months follow-up using the auditory-perceptual Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, and Strain (GRBAS) scale and patient perception measures. Results The control group demonstrated significant deterioration in vocal roughness (P = 0.02) between 6 to 12 months, whilst the VR group did not, resulting in a significant difference (P {\textless} 0.01) between the two groups at 12 months. A between-group significant difference (P = 0.02) was also observed for breathiness at 12 months. Patient perceptions of improved vocal quality, acceptability, hoarseness, vocal fatigue, and ashamed (of voice) pre- to post-VR improved significantly (P {\textless} 0.02) in the VR group, although significant difference (P = 0.03) between groups was observed post-VR for hoarseness only. Conclusion For this study group representing Tis to T4-size laryngeal cancers, patients receiving voice rehabilitation post radiotherapy demonstrated no functional decline in vocal roughness and perceived their voice to improve to a greater extent post-VR than the control group.

abstract = {Background/Aims: Serum sodium predicts prognosis in cirrhosis and may improve the prognostic accuracy of the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, but the available information is limited. The aim of the present study was to assess the prognostic value of serum sodium in the prediction of survival at 3 and 12 months after listing in patients with cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation, and to compare its predictive value with that of the MELD score. Patients and methods: 308 consecutive patients with cirrhosis listed for transplantation during a 5-year period were included in the study. The end-point was survival at 3 and 12 months before transplantation. Variables obtained at the time of listing were analysed for prognostic value using multivariable analysis. Accuracy of prognostic variables was analysed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: The MELD score and serum sodium concentration were the only independent predictors of survival at 3 and 12 months after listing. Low serum sodium was associated with an increased risk of death in all subpopulations of patients with cirrhosis categorised according to the major complication developed before listing. The area under the ROC curves for serum sodium and MELD score was not significantly different both at 3 months (0.83 vs 0.79, respectively) and at 12 months (0.70 vs 0.77, respectively). The addition of serum sodium did not significantly improve the accuracy of the MELD score in the prediction of survival at 3 and 12 months. Conclusion: In patients with cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation, serum sodium and MELD were found to be independent predictors of survival. Larger studies are needed to determine whether the addition of serum sodium to MELD can improve its prognostic accuracy.},

abstract = {Objective: Many voice-rating tools are either physician-derived, disease-specific measures or they merely combine general quality-of-life domains with vocal symptoms. The aim of this series of studies was to devise and validate a patient-derived inventory of voice symptoms for use as a sensitive assessment tool of (i) baseline pathology and (ii) response to change in adult dysphonia clinics. Method: Three stages in the development of the instrument are described. First, an initial exploratory, open-ended questionnaire study was used to compile a prototype list of voice complaints [Clin Otolaryngol 22 (1997) 37]. Second, the prototype list was administered to 168 subjects with dysphonia and underwent principal components analysis. Qualitatively, it was also assessed at this stage for its ability to capture voice-related impairment, disability and handicap. Third, a modified 44-item scale was administered to 180 new subjects. Results: The symptoms were highly endorsed. Principal components analysis with oblique rotation yielded a Voice Symptom Scale (VoiSS); 43 of the items comprise a 'general voice pathology' scale. More specifically, five oblique components provided assessments of: 'communication problems,' 'throat infections,' 'psychosocial distress,' 'voice sound and variability' and 'phlegm.' Conclusion: The VoiSS is simple for patients to complete and easy to score. It is sensitive enough to reflect the wide range of communication, physical symptoms and emotional responses implicit in adult dysphonia. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract = {A recent mandate emphasizes severity of liver disease to determine priorities in allocating organs for liver transplantation and necessitates a disease severity index based on generalizable, verifiable, and easily obtained variables. The aim of the study was to examine the generalizability of a model previously created to estimate survival of patients undergoing the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure in patient groups with a broader range of disease severity and etiology. The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) consists of serum bilirubin and creatinine levels, International Normalized Ratio (INR) for prothrombin time, and etiology of liver disease. The model's validity was tested in 4 independent data sets, including (1) patients hospitalized for hepatic decompensation (referred to as "hospitalized" patients), (2) ambulatory patients with noncholestatic cirrhosis, (3) patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), and (4) unselected patients from the 1980s with cirrhosis (referred to as "historical" patients). In these patients, the model's ability to classify patients according to their risk of death was examined using the concordance (c)-statistic. The MELD scale performed well in predicting death within 3 months with a c-statistic of (1) 0.87 for hospitalized patients, (2) 0.80 for noncholestatic ambulatory patients, (3) 0.87 for PBC patients, and (4) 0.78 for historical cirrhotic patients. Individual complications of portal hypertension had minimal impact on the model's prediction (range of improvement in c-statistic: {\textless}.01 for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and variceal hemorrhage to ascites: 0.01-0.03). The MELD scale is a reliable measure of mortality risk in patients with end-stage liver disease and suitable for use as a disease severity index to determine organ allocation priorities.},

abstract = {Priority for liver transplantation is based on the Model for Endstage Liver Disease (MELD) score, a mathematical function which includes international normalized ratio (INR). We present an analysis to determine the lab-to-lab variation in INR at 14 clinical laboratories across the United States. We performed a survey to identify representative clinical laboratories across the United States, where INR was measured in the determination of MELD score. Five 'standard' samples for INR were formulated and were sent to the 14 clinical laboratories to determine variation in INR and MELD score. Among the 14 clinical laboratories, the range in INR for the five samples was: sample 1 (1.2-2.0), sample 2 (1.4-2.5), sample 3 (1.7-3.4), sample 4 (1.9-3.7) and sample 5 (2.4-5.1). The range in calculated MELD score was: sample 1 (8-14), sample 2 (10-17), sample 3 (12-20), sample 4 (14-21) and sample 5 (16-25). The selection of the clinical laboratory used to determine INR may result in substantial changes in MELD score independent of severity-of-illness. These data suggest that further review of interlaboratory variation in MELD should be undertaken because of the potential impact on prioritization for liver transplantation.},

Clinical data were extracted for all adult primary liver transplantation candidates from our institution who were listed with the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) between 1990 and 1999. Serum creatinine, bilirubin, and international normalized ratio (INR) were obtained from an institutional laboratory database. Cox models were constructed using current MELD, change in MELD (Delta), and number of MELD scores to predict survival on the waiting list. Eight hundred and sixty-one patients met inclusion criteria, 639 underwent transplantation, and 80 died while waiting. A one-unit increment in current MELD imparted significant hazard ratios ranging from 1.12 to 1.19 in all models. Delta MELD was predictive of mortality univariately, but less predictive when current MELD was included, and not predictive when considered with both current and number of MELD scores. Overall, current MELD is the single most important determinant of mortality risk on the waiting list. Delta MELD is predictive of death only within 4 d of the event; however, part of this correlates with the dying process itself, thus limiting Delta MELD's utility in survival prediction models.},

Although implant extrusion is a well-known risk of ML, management of this complication is rarely mentioned in the literature. The aim of this study was to review our experience with endoscopic implant retrieval for a group of patients with extruding ML implants. METHODS: All patients identified in our institution from January 1989 through August 2004 with a history of ML and extruded implants were identified. Case management was reviewed, including information on presentation, management techniques, and outcomes. RESULTS: Five patients presented with extruding ML (Gore-Tex [n = 2] or silastic [n = 3]) implants. All patients presented with worsening dysphonia and evidence of fullness and/or granulation tissue at the extrusion site. Endoscopic removal was performed using either sharp dissection or CO2 laser dissection. After removal, four patients underwent vocal fold injection augmentation. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic removal appears to be a safe, effective, and even preferred alternative to external transcervical removal in selected cases of extruding implants.},

abstract = {Liver allocation policy in the U.S. was recently changed to a continuous disease severity scale with minimal weight given to time waiting in an effort to better prioritize deceased donor liver transplant candidates. We compared rates of waiting list registrations, removals, transplants, and deaths during the year prior to implementation of the new liver allocation policy (2/27/01-2/26/02, Era 1) with the first year's experience (2/27/02-2/26/03, Era 2) under this new policy. Rates were adjusted for 1,000 patient years on the waiting list and compared using z-tests. A 1-sided test was used to compare death rates; 2-sided tests were used to compare transplant rates. Overall and subgroup analyses were performed for demographic, geographic, and medical strata. In Era 2, we observed a 12{\%} reduction in new liver transplant waiting list registrations, with the largest reductions seen in new registrants with low MELD/PELD scores. In Era 2, there was a 3.5{\%} reduction in waiting list death rate (P =.076) and a 10.2{\%} increase in cadaveric transplants (P {\textless}.001). The reduction in waiting list mortality and increase in transplantation rates were evenly distributed across all demographic and medical strata, with some variation across geographic variables. Early patient and graft survival after deceased donor liver transplantation remains unchanged. In conclusion, by eliminating the categorical waiting list prioritization system that emphasized time waiting, the new system has been associated with reduced registrations and improved transplantation rates without increased mortality rates for individual groups of waiting candidates or changes in early transplant survival rates.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature Introduction: There is no consensus on which voice outcome indicators (VOIs) should be used to compare the merits of the various surgical treatments for unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP). Authors performed a literature review to identify which VOIs are most frequently used and most relevant, in terms of significant change in pre- and post-operative measurements, to assess UVFP surgical treatments. Method: A Medline/Pubmed literature review was performed and the most frequently used VOIs were identified using a Pareto diagram. For these most frequently used VOI's, the number of studies that showed a statistically significant change in pre- and post-operative results were compared to the total number of studies found using that same VOI, this portion was expressed in percent. This percentage was defined as the “percentage of significance” and used to assess changes of each VOI. Results: Eleven VOIs were identified using the Pareto analysis. These were, in decreasing order of frequency of citation: maximum phonation time (MPT), jitter, Shimmer, video-stroboscopic examination, noise to harmonic ratio (NHR/HNR), mean air flow (MeAF), fundamental frequency (F0), “Infrequent Perceptional Scales”, GRBAS scale, mean subglottic pressure (MSGP). MPT, MeAF, factor G of GRBAS-I, Jitter, shimmer and VHI-30 had respective “percentage of significance” of 90, 86, 85, 74, 68 and 64{\%}, respectively. Conclusion: The results indicate that MPT, MeAF and GRBAS-I, represent the top-three most frequently used and the most relevant VOIs in terms of “percentage of significance”. VHI-30 showed a relatively low rate of use and low “percentage of significance”. The role of Jitter and Shimmer remains unclear. Finally, MSGP and the F0 appear to be less relevant VOIs for the evaluation of UFVP surgical treatments in terms of significant change in pre- and post-operative measurements.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thyroplasty type I, as introduced by Isshiki and colleagues almost 30 years ago, has become the gold standard of improving glottal incompetence caused by unilateral vocal fold paralysis. Intraoperative assessment of the adequacy of glottal closure is subjective and based on the perceptual judgment of vocal quality and degree of improvement in glottal gap size. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESES: The primary purpose of this study was to investigate whether the intraoperative measurement of maximum phonation time (MPT) is an adequate predictor of voice outcome after thyroplasty type I. To assess this possibility, it was necessary to evaluate the effect of body posture (seated vs. supine) and anesthesia (none vs. light sedation) on the measure of MPT. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study of 20 individuals with unilateral vocal fold paralysis was undertaken. METHODS: Subjects were assessed at three time points: pre-, intra-, and postoperatively across parameters of breathiness rating, glottal gap size, glottal flow rate, and MPT. RESULTS: Results indicated that MPT was significantly lower in the supine versus seated position. In addition, light sedation resulted in a trend toward lower MPT that was not statistically significant. Finally, the intraoperative measurement of MPT, although lower than a 1-month postoperative measurement, was significantly predictive of the outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The intraoperative measure of MPT appears to be an adequate predictor of the postoperative outcome.},

abstract = {Summary: Speech range profile (SRP) is a graphical display of frequency-intensity occurring interactions during functional speech activity. Few studies have suggested the potential clinical applications of SRP. However, these studies are limited to qualitative case comparisons and vocally healthy participants. The present study aimed to examine the effects of voice disorders on speaking and maximum voice ranges in a group of vocally untrained women. It also aimed to examine whether voice limit measures derived from SRP were as sensitive as those derived from voice range profile (VRP) in distinguishing dysphonic from healthy voices. Ninety dysphonic women with laryngeal pathologies and 35 women with normal voices, who served as controls, participated in this study. Each subject recorded a VRP for her physiological vocal limits. In addition, each subject read aloud the "North Wind and the Sun" passage to record SRP. All the recordings were captured and analyzed by Soundswell's computerized real-time phonetogram Phog 1.0 (Hitech Development AB, T??by, Sweden). The SRPs and the VRPs were compared between the two groups of subjects. Univariate analysis results demonstrated that individual SRP measures were less sensitive than the corresponding VRP measures in discriminating dysphonic from normal voices. However, stepwise logistic regression analyses revealed that the combination of only two SRP measures was almost as effective as a combination of three VRP measures in predicting the presence of dysphonia (overall prediction accuracy: 93.6{\%} for SRP vs 96.0{\%} for VRP). These results suggest that in a busy clinic where quick voice screening results are desirable, SRP can be an acceptable alternate procedure to VRP. ?? 2007 The Voice Foundation.},

abstract = {Background. The role of orthotopic liver trans- plantation in the treatment of patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma is controversial, and determin- ing which patients are likely to have a good outcome after liver transplantation is difficult. Methods. We studied 48 patients with cirrhosis who had small, unresectable hepatocellular carcinomas and who underwent liver transplantation. In 94 percent of the patients, the cirrhosis was related to infection with hepati- tis B virus, hepatitis C virus, or both. The presence of tumor was confirmed by biopsy or serum alpha-fetoprotein as- say. The criteria for eligibility for transplantation were the presence of a tumor 5 cm or less in diameter in patients with single hepatocellular carcinomas and no more than three tumor nodules, each 3 cm or less in diameter, in pa- tients with multiple tumors. Twenty-eight patients with suf- ficient hepatic function underwent treatment for the tumor, mainly chemoembolization, before transplantation. After liver transplantation, the patients were followed prospec- tively for a median of 26 months (range, 9 to 54). No anti- cancer treatment was given after transplantation. Results. The overall mortality rate was 17 percent. Af-ter four years, the actuarial survival rate was 75 percent and the rate of recurrence-free survival was 83 percent. Hepatocellular carcinoma recurred in four patients (8 per- cent). The overall and recurrence-free survival rates at four years among the 35 patients (73 percent of the total) who met the predetermined criteria for the selection of small hepatocellular carcinomas at pathological review of the explanted liver were 85 percent and 92 percent, re- spectively, whereas the rates in the 13 patients (27 per- cent) whose tumors exceeded these limits were 50 per- cent and 59 percent, respectively (P ? 0.01 for overall survival; P ? 0.002 for recurrence-free survival). In this group of 48 patients with early-stage tumors, tumor–node– metastasis status, the number of tumors, the serum alpha- fetoprotein concentration, treatment received before trans- plantation, and 10 other variables were not significantly correlated with survival. Conclusions. Liver transplantation is an effective treat- ment for small, unresectable hepatocellular carcino- mas in patients with cirrhosis. (N Engl J Med 1996;334: 693-9.)},

abstract = {In 2010, modified RECIST (mRECIST) criteria were proposed as a way of adapting the RECIST criteria to the particularities of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We intended to overcome some limitations of RECIST in measuring tumour shrinkage with local and systemic therapies, and also to refine the assessment of progression that could be misinterpreted with conventional RECIST 1.1, due to clinical events related to the natural progression of chronic liver disease (development of ascites, enlargement of lymph nodes, etc.). mRECIST has served its purpose since being adopted or included in clinical practice guidelines (European, American and Asian) for the management of HCC; it has also been instrumental for assessing response and time-to-event endpoints in several phase II and III investigations. Nowadays, mRECIST has become the standard tool for measurement of radiological endpoints at early/intermediate stages of HCC. At advanced stages, guidelines recommend both methods. mRECIST has been proven to capture higher objective response rates in tumours treated with molecular therapies and those responses have shown to be independently associated with better survival. With the advent of novel treatment approaches (i.e. immunotherapy) and combination therapies there is a need to further refine and clarify some concepts around the performance of mRECIST. Similarly, changes in the landscape of standard of care at advanced stages of the disease are pointing towards progression-free survival as a potential primary endpoint in some phase III investigations, as effective therapies applied beyond progression might mask overall survival results. Strict recommendations for adopting this endpoint have been reported. Overall, we review the performance of mRECIST during the last decade, incorporating novel clarifications and refinements in light of emerging challenges in the study and management of HCC.},

Computed tomography (CT) and fiberscopic examinations were performed at two weeks and three months postoperatively.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: No aspiration and laryngeal stenosis was observed in the nine patients. CT scanning showed that titanium mesh was fastened well without displacement and deformity and that there was no laryngeal stenosis. Fiberscopic inspection showed that the larynx lumen was maintained well without stricture, shrinkage, and necrosis. No titanium mesh was exposed to the larynx lumen.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Titanium mesh was a good alternative for reconstruction of the laryngeal framework. It provided adequate structural support to maintain airway patency.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND A measure of donor liver quality, the donor liver index, was developed and validated for the UK population of transplant recipients. Unlike previously proposed measures, this index is only based on variables that are available at the point of retrieval, and so does not include cold ischaemic time. METHODS Indices of liver quality were based on data from the UK Transplant Registry on all 7929 liver transplants between January 2000 and December 2014. RESULTS The donor liver index (DLI) was based on factors shown to affect graft survival, which included donor age, sex, height, type (donor after brain death or circulatory death), bilirubin, smoking history, and whether the liver was split. A separate index (DLI1) looking at 1 year survival showed donor cardiac disease, black ethnicity, and steatosis to be additional risk factors.A strong association was found between DLI and whether or not a surgeon accepts an offered liver for transplant, with a marked fall in acceptance rates for livers with an index greater than 1.31. Since 2000, there has been a notable reduction in the quality of livers transplanted, coupled with variation between the 7 UK liver transplant centres in risk appetite. CONCLUSION The DLI is an index of liver quality which enables analysis of the changing trends in liver quality and centre behaviour. DLI1 enables identification of factors affecting shorter term survival, and perhaps identifies a cohort of livers that may benefit from novel preservation technologies.},

abstract = {The pediatric end-stage liver disease (PELD) model accurately estimates 90-day waitlist mortality for pediatric liver transplant candidates, but it has been unclear if PELD can identify patients who will derive survival benefit from undergoing liver transplantation (LT), if it correlates with posttransplant survival, or if it can identify patients for whom LT would be futile. Pediatric patients who underwent LT between 2001 and 2004 were enrolled through the United Network for Organ Sharing Organ Procurement and Transplant Network database. Survival benefit was measured in terms of life-years gained during the first year after LT. Complete data were available for 1,247 patients: 53{\%} were listed as Status 1 at the time of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), while the remaining 47{\%} had PELD scores. Only in patients with a PELD of 17+ or those designated as United Network for Organ Sharing Status 1 derived a survival benefit within 1 year of LT; patients with a PELD score of {\textless} or = 16 did not. In addition, a statistically significant association was seen between 1-year post-OLT survival and PELD at LT (P = 0.03). No "threshold" PELD score, beyond which risk of post-LT mortality increased dramatically, was apparent. In conclusion, pediatric patients with a PELD score of 17+ derive survival benefit early after LT, and increasing PELD scores are associated with increasing transplant benefit after liver transplantation. PELD does correlate with posttransplant survival but should not be used as a marker for futility. Copyright 2006 AASLD},

Early and correct treatment should be performed to avoid complications, such as permanent facial nerve dysfunction. Objective The objective of this study is to review the prognosis of the facial palsy on Ramsay Hunt syndrome, considering the different treatments proposed in the literature. Data Synthesis We read the abstract of 78 studies; we selected 31 studies and read them in full. We selected 19 studies for appraisal. Among the 882 selected patients, 621 (70.4{\%}) achieved a House-Brackmann score of I or II; 68{\%} of the patients treated only with steroids achieved HB I or II, versus 70.5{\%} when treated with steroids plus antiviral agents.

A second set of eight larynges was used to evaluate medialization laryngoplasty using a Silastic implant without and with arytenoid adduction.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: IL and ML led to comparable decreases in phonation threshold flow (PTF), phonation threshold pressure (PTP), and phonation threshold power (PTW). ML-AA led to significant decreases in PTF (P = .008), PTP (P = .008), and PTW (P = .008). IL and ML led to approximately equal decreases in percent jitter and percent shimmer. ML-AA caused the greatest increase in signal-to-noise ratio. ML-AA discernibly decreased frequency (P = 0.059); a clear trend was not observed for IL or ML. IL significantly reduced mucosal wave amplitude (P = 0.002), whereas both ML and ML-AA increased it. All procedures significantly decreased glottal gap, with the most dramatic effects observed after ML-AA (P = 0.004).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: ML-AA led to the greatest improvements in phonatory parameters. IL was comparable to ML aerodynamically and acoustically, but caused detrimental changes to the mucosal wave. Incremental improvements in parameters recorded from the same larynx were observed after ML and ML-AA. To ensure optimal acoustic outcome, the arytenoid must be correctly rotated. This study provides objective support for the combined ML-AA procedure in tolerant patients.},

Postoperative airway, deglutition, and voice were assessed. Postoperative follow-up ranged from 1 to 58 months (median, 27 months). All 10 patients sustained blunt or penetrating laryngeal trauma. After patients were resuscitated according to the ABC principles recommended by the American College of Surgeons, each underwent open repair of laryngeal fractures using rigid adaptation plates.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Outcome was measured by perceptual analysis of the postoperative airway, swallowing, and voice, as well as biocompatibility. Ten patients underwent repair and stabilization of the larynx using adaptation plates. Nine patients sustained blunt trauma, and one patient sustained penetrating trauma. Voice was subjectively graded as good if it resembled the preinjury status, fair if it differed, and poor if it represented aphonia, whisper, or unintelligible speech. Airway was graded as good if it resembled preinjury status, fair if mild exercise intolerance or aspiration existed, and poor if the patient could not be decannulated. Nine patients had a good airway following repair, and six of seven patients requiring tracheotomy were decannulated. All patients tolerated the plates well and suffered no surgical complications.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Repair of the laryngeal framework using adaptation plates provides adequate, immediate stabilization with restoration of function and is an alternative to traditional methods of repair.},

The purpose of this investigation was to compare the short- and long-term results in patients undergoing thyroplasty type I. METHODS: Data on 26 patients who had undergone thyroplasty type I for management of unilateral vocal fold paralysis were compared from before surgery to the short-term (1-month) and long-term ({\textgreater}1-year) postoperative assessment points. Statistical analysis included paired tests to assess the significance of between-group differences. RESULTS: Significant differences were found between the preoperative and both postoperative evaluations for the measures of mean glottal flow rate, maximum phonation time, jitter, shimmer, and harmonic-to-noise ratio. However, no significant differences were found between the 1-month and {\textgreater}1-year assessment points. CONCLUSIONS: The results for the parameters studied appeared to reach maximum improvement within 1 month after surgery. It is possible that the effects of time, including the normal aging process, hormonal changes, or other alterations in general health, may require longer follow-up to better address these issues.},

The fistula rate for patients who underwent immediate PMMC flap was 28.6{\%}, intermediate to primary closure and PMMF flap. Several factors were evaluated for relationship to fistula, but no significant associations were identified. However, patients with fistula tended to have longer inpatient stays and may have been more likely to have a history of cardiovascular or hypoxic disease.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Pharyngocutaneous fistula is a well-established complication of total laryngectomy and is especially a concern in patients with a previous history of radiation. Our retrospective review demonstrates that PMMF onlay flap appears to be more effective in reducing the rate of fistula compared to primary closure in these patients. Myocutaneous augmentation flaps, in contrast, have a fairly high fistula rate and may be better replaced with alternative closures such as free flaps.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.

abstract = {Clinical acoustic voice-recording analysis is usually performed using classical perturbation measures, including jitter, shimmer, and noise-to-harmonic ratios (NHRs). However, restrictive mathematical limitations of these measures prevent analysis for severely dysphonic voices. Previous studies of alternative nonlinear random measures addressed wide varieties of vocal pathologies. Here, we analyze a single vocal pathology cohort, testing the performance of these alternative measures alongside classical measures. We present voice analysis pre- and postoperatively in 17 patients with unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP). The patients underwent standard medialization thyroplasty surgery, and the voices were analyzed using jitter, shimmer, NHR, nonlinear recurrence period density entropy (RPDE), detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), and correlation dimension. In addition, we similarly analyzed 11 healthy controls. Systematizing the preanalysis editing of the recordings, we found that the novel measures were more stable and, hence, reliable than the classical measures on healthy controls. RPDE and jitter are sensitive to improvements pre- to postoperation. Shimmer, NHR, and DFA showed no significant change (P {\textgreater} 0.05). All measures detect statistically significant and clinically important differences between controls and patients, both treated and untreated (P {\textless} 0.001, area under curve [AUC] {\textgreater} 0.7). Pre- to postoperation grade, roughness, breathiness, asthenia, and strain (GRBAS) ratings show statistically significant and clinically important improvement in overall dysphonia grade (G) (AUC = 0.946, P {\textless} 0.001). Recalculating AUCs from other study data, we compare these results in terms of clinical importance. We conclude that, when preanalysis editing is systematized, nonlinear random measures may be useful for monitoring UVFP-treatment effectiveness, and there may be applications to other forms of dysphonia. ?? 2011 The Voice Foundation.},

We conducted a quality assurance study to inform clinical program development.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Between January 2011 and May 2012, 100 consecutive brain metastases patients referred and assessed through a multidisciplinary clinic were evaluated for baseline characteristics, radiotherapy use, and supportive care decisions. Overall survival was examined by known prognostic groups. Proportion of patients receiving end-of-life radiotherapy (death within 30 and 14 days of brain radiotherapy) was used as a quality metric.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The median age was 65 years, with non-small cell lung cancer (n = 38) and breast cancer (n = 23) being the most common primary cancers. At least 57 patients were engaged in advance care planning discussions at first consult visit. In total, 75 patients eventually underwent brain radiotherapy, whereas 25 did not. The most common reasons for nonradiotherapy management were patient preference and rapid clinical deterioration. Overall survival for prognostic subgroups was consistent with literature reports. End-of-life brain radiotherapy was observed in 9 {\%} (death within 30 days) and 1 {\%} (within 14 days) of treated patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: By integrating palliative care expertise to address the complex needs of patients with newly diagnosed brain metastases, end-of-life radiotherapy use appears acceptable and improved over historical rates at our institution. An appreciable proportion of patients are not suitable for palliative brain radiotherapy or opt against this treatment option, but the team approach involving nurses, palliative care experts, allied health, and clinical oncologists facilitates patient-centered decision making and transition to end-of-life care.},

abstract = {Background—Remodeling biomarkers carry high potential for predicting adverse events in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients. However, temporal patterns during the course of CHF, and especially the trajectory before an adverse event, are unknown. We studied the prognostic value of temporal patterns of 14 cardiac remodeling biomarker candidates in stable patients with CHF from the Bio-SHiFT (Serial Biomarker Measurements and New Echocardiographic Techniques in Chronic Heart Failure Patients Result in Tailored Prediction of Prognosis) study. Methods and Results—In 263 CHF patients, we performed trimonthly blood sampling during a median follow-up of 2.2 years. For the analysis, we selected all baseline samples, the 2 samples closest to the primary end point (PE), or the last sample available for end point–free patients. Thus, in 567 samples, we measured suppression of tumorigenicity-2, galectin-3, galectin-4, growth differentiation factor-15, matrix metalloproteinase-2, 3, and 9, tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase-4, perlecan, aminopeptidase-N, caspase-3, cathepsin-D, cathepsin-Z, and cystatin-B. The PE was a composite of cardiovascular mortality, heart transplantation, left ventricular assist device implantation, and HF hospitalization. Associations between repeatedly measured biomarker candidates and the PE were investigated by joint modeling. Median age was 68 (interquartile range: 59–76) years with 72{\%} men; 70 patients reached the PE. Repeatedly measured suppression of tumorigenicity-2, galectin-3, galectin-4, growth differentiation factor-15, matrix metalloproteinase-2 and 9, tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase-4, perlecan, cathepsin-D, and cystatin-B levels were significantly associated with the PE, and increased as the PE approached. The slopes of biomarker trajectories were also predictors of clinical outcome, independent of their absolute level. Associations persisted after adjustment for clinical characteristics and pharmacological treatment. Suppression of tumorigenicity-2 was the strongest predictor (hazard ratio: 7.55 per SD difference, 95{\%} CI: 5.53–10.30), followed by growth differentiation factor-15 (4.06, 2.98–5.54) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (3.59, 2.55–5.05). Conclusions—Temporal patterns of remodeling biomarker candidates predict adverse clinical outcomes in CHF.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surgical complication rates of total laryngectomy vary according to the preoperative treatments performed and patient factors. Wound complications after salvage laryngectomy following concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) were analyzed. METHODS: Eighty-six patients who had undergone total laryngectomy for laryngeal cancer at Hokkaido University Hospital, Japan, between 1990 and 2006 were divided into three groups according to preoperative treatments received: group I (n = 35) without radiotherapy (RT) or CCRT, group II (n = 17) RT alone, and group III (n = 34) low-dose CCRT. Salvage total laryngectomy was performed as a consequence of residual or recurrent disease after completion of the treatments. Wound complications such as pharyngocutaneous fistulas, bleeding, infections, and skin necrosis were retrospectively analyzed in each group. RESULTS: A considerable (not statistically significant) difference in the incidence of major wound complications was observed between groups I and III (11.4{\%} vs 29.4{\%}, P = 0.078), but not between groups II and III. In stage III/IV patients, a significant increase in the incidence of wound complications was observed in group III compared to group I. Pharyngocutaneous fistulas were the most common complication, occurring in 8/34 (23.5{\%}) of the group III patients. Additional pharyngeal reconstruction surgery was performed in 5 of the 8 (62.5{\%}) group III patients with pha ryngocutaneous fistulas, while no such patients (0/3) in group I required reconstruction surgery. CONCLUSION: There was an increased risk of wound complications in patients undergoing salvage laryngectomy following CCRT. Patients who developed pharyngocutaneous fistulas after CCRT tended to require surgical reintervention for repair. These findings should be taken into account before the initiation of CCRT and salvage surgery.},

abstract = {Hyponatremia in advanced cirrhosis and ascites or congestive heart failure (CHF) is the result of an inappropriate increase in vasopressin secretion, which acts through activation of specific V2 receptors in the distal renal nephron to increase water reabsorption. This study investigates the efficacy and safety of 3 different doses of the V2 receptor antagonist, VPA-985, in correcting hyponatremia over a 7-day inpatient study period. Forty-four hospitalized patients (33 patients with cirrhosis, 6 with CHF, and 5 with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) were studied on a constant sodium intake, with VPA doses of 25,125, and 250 mg twice daily or placebo. Serum sodium measurements were repeated after every daily dose, and the next dose withheld for excessive serum sodium rises. Fluid intake was adjusted according to previous 24-hour urinary outputs. Adverse events were based on clinical signs of dehydration or encephalopathy. VPA-985 produced a significant overall aquaretic response compared with placebo, with significant dose related increases in free water clearance (P {\textless} .05) and serum sodium (P {\textless} .05), without significant changes in orthostatic blood pressure or serum creatinine levels. Five patients (50{\%}) on 250 mg twice daily had to have medication withheld on multiple occasions. End-of-study plasma vasopressin levels increased significantly in the 2 larger dose groups. In conclusion, VPA-985 appears effective and safe in appropriate doses in correcting abnormal renal water handling and hyponatremia in conditions associated with water retention. Higher doses of VPA-985 may produce significant dehydration and will require close monitoring with their use.},

METHODS Data were procured from the Standard Transplant Analysis and Research dataset files. Donors with CNS tumors were identified, and recipients from these donors comprised the study group (Group I). The remaining recipients of organs from donors who did not have CNS tumors formed the control group (Group II). Incidence of recipient CNS tumors, donor-related malignancies, and overall survival were calculated and compared in addition to multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS A cohort of 58 314 adult thoracic organ recipients were included, of which 337 received organs from donors who had documented CNS tumors (Group I). None of these recipients developed CNS tumors at a median follow-up of 72 months (IR: 30-130 months). Although overall mortality in terms of the percentage was higher in Group I than Group II (163/320=51{\%} vs 22 123/52 691=42{\%}), Kaplan-Meier curves indicate no significant difference in the time to death between the two groups (P=.92).

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Understanding of swallowing pressures after total laryngectomy (TL) and what constitutes a "functional" swallow are limited. Mobile structures are altered or removed after TL, with consequent effects on pressure profiles. High-resolution manometry (HRM) can characterize these pressures. METHODS: Six TL subjects without dysphagia and 6 controls underwent pharyngeal HRM. Timing and pressure variables for the velopharynx, mesopharynx, and upper esophageal sphincter (UES) were compared. Changes in variables due to bolus volume were evaluated in TL subjects. RESULTS: The TL subjects had increased duration of velopharyngeal pressure (P = .012). Maximum mesopharyngeal pressure was lower versus controls (P = .003). Maximal and total pre-opening (P = .002, P = .002) and post-closure (P = .001, P = .002) UES pressures were lower. Maximum mesopharyngeal pressure (P = .032) decreased with increasing bolus volume. CONCLUSIONS: Increased velopharyngeal pressure duration and total swallow duration reflect separation of the pharynx into distinct conduits for air and food, thus ensuring successful bolus passage without the need for respiration. Decreased UES pressure highlights the effects of disrupting the cricopharyngeal and rostral esophageal muscle fibers from their attachments to the larynx and performing a cricopharyngeal myotomy. Additional studies including subjects with dysphagia could further characterize the functional TL swallow and identify aspects susceptible to dysfunction.},

The authors hypothesize that cricopharyngeus myotomy reduces sphincteric pressure, thereby diminishing forces against the pharyngeal suture line. Peak pharyngeal pressures were recorded in patients who underwent total laryngectomy with and without cricopharyngeus myotomy. In patients without concurrent myotomy, peak pharyngeal pressures were all greater than 60 mm Hg. With concurrent myotomy, peak pharyngeal pressures averaged less than 40 mm Hg. Concurrent myotomy carries with it the potential for minimizing postoperative fistulization, eliminating dysphagia of cricopharyngeus spasm, and improving the acquisition of alaryngeal speech.},

This study retrospectively compared clinical outcomes in patients with RHS treated with the antiviral agents acyclovir and famciclovir. PATIENTS AND METHODS:: This study involved 227 patients diagnosed with RHS from 2003 to 2015. Patients were treated with prednisolone plus acyclovir (n?=?102) or famciclovir (n?=?125). Patient outcomes were measured using the House–Brackmann scale according to age, initial severity of disease, electroneurography, and underlying disease. RESULTS:: Based on complications (p?=?0.019) and disease severity (p?=?0.013), the overall complete recovery rate was significantly higher with famciclovir than with acyclovir, whereas rates of recovery in patients with severe (p?=?0.111) and initially moderate (grades III–IV; p?=?0.070) facial palsy were similar. Electroneurography also showed no difference in remission rate between the two groups (p?=?0.692). Complete recovery rates in patients with hypertension and/or diabetes mellitus were similar in the two groups. However, the complete recovery rate of patients without hypertension and diabetes was significantly higher in patients treated with famciclovir than acyclovir (p?=?0.018). CONCLUSION:: Recovery rates in patients with RHS were higher following treatment with steroid plus famciclovir than with steroid plus acyclovir, especially in patients without hypertension and diabetes mellitus.},

Methods LSAM projections for 1 year of liver transplants before and after the Share 35 policy change were compared with observed data during the same period. Numbers of organs recovered, organ sharing, transplant rates, and waitlist mortality rates (per 100 waitlist years) were evaluated by LSAM and compared with observed data. Results Candidate, recipient, and donor characteristics in the LSAM cohorts were similar to those in the observed population before and after Share 35. LSAM correctly predicted more accepted organs and fewer discarded organs with Share 35. LSAM also predicted increased regional and national sharing, consistent with observed data, although the magnitude was overestimated. Transplant rates were correctly projected to increase and waitlist death rates to decrease.

By constructing and validating joint models (JMs), we aimed to predict the outcome based on all available data, using both disease severity and its rate of change over time. Adult LT candidates listed in Eurotransplant between 2007 and 2018 (n = 16 283) and UNOS between 2016 and 2019 (n = 30 533) were included. Patients with acute liver failure, exception points, or priority status were excluded. Longitudinal MELD(-Na) data were modeled using spline-based mixed effects. Waiting list survival was modeled with Cox proportional hazards models. The JMs combined the longitudinal and survival analysis. JM 90-day mortality prediction performance was compared to MELD(-Na) in the validation cohorts. MELD(-Na) score and its rate of change over time significantly influenced patient survival. The JMs significantly outperformed the MELD(-Na) score at baseline and during follow-up. At baseline, MELD-JM AUC and MELD AUC were 0.94 (0.92–0.95) and 0.87 (0.85–0.89), respectively.

abstract = {Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a syndrome characterised by acute decompensation of chronic liver disease associated with organ failures and high short-term mortality. Alcohol and chronic viral hepatitis are the most common underlying liver diseases. Up to 40{\%}-50{\%} of the cases of ACLF have no identifiable trigger; in the remaining patients, sepsis, active alcoholism and relapse of chronic viral hepatitis are the most common reported precipitating factors. An excessive systemic inflammatory response seems to play a crucial role in the development of ACLF. Using a liver-adapted sequential organ assessment failure score, it is possible to triage and prognosticate the outcome of patients with ACLF. The course of ACLF is dynamic and changes over the course of hospital admission. Most of the patients will have a clear prognosis between day 3 and 7 of hospital admission and clinical decisions such as evaluation for liver transplant or discussion over goals of care could be tailored using clinical scores. Bioartificial liver support systems, granulocyte-colony stimulating factors or stem-cell transplant are in the horizon of medical care of this patient population; however, data are too premature to implement them as standard of care.},

Ten men and 10 women with normal voices participated as subjects in the study, and a counterbalanced design was used. Results indicated that there is no obvious preference for the use of either method, although considerable individual differences are noted.},

The main presenting symptoms and signs were hoarseness, neck tenderness, dysphagia, and neck emphysema. Sites of laryngeal injury included arytenoid swelling, vocal fold injury, soft tissue contusion or superficial mucosal laceration, cricoarytenoid dislocation, thyroid fracture, epiglottic fracture and mixed injuries. Treatment was varied depending on the severity of the injuries. Sixteen cases were managed conservatively by medical treatment; two cases received intubation; four cases were treated initially by tracheostomy; eight cases received surgical repair and/or reconstruction; cases made a full recovery of the voice and 18 cases fair voice recovery due to either sustained vocal fold swelling or limitation of vocal fold movement. One case was graded as poor. Twenty-eight cases had good airway patency and two cases fair airway patency. A delay in the early detection of laryngeal trauma may precipitate into life-threatening airway problems, therefore prompt and accurate diagnosis should be followed immediately by skillful airway management.},

abstract = {PURPOSETo compare the safety and efficacy of corticorelin acetate (CrA) and placebo in patients with malignant brain tumors requiring chronic administration of dexamethasone (DEX) to control the signs and symptoms of peritumoral brain edema (PBE). PATIENTS AND METHODSProspective, randomized, double-blind study of 200 patients with PBE on a stable dose of DEX. Initially, DEX dose was decreased by 50{\%} over a 2-week period and then held at this level for 3 weeks. The primary end point was the proportion of patients who responded to treatment-patients who achieved a ≥ 50{\%} DEX reduction from baseline and achieved stable or improved neurologic examination score and Karnofsky performance score at week 2, and then continued to respond at week 5.ResultsOne hundred patients received subcutaneous injections of 1 mg twice per day of CrA and 100 patients received placebo for the duration of the study period. Although results did not attain statistical significance (at the P {\textless} .05 level), a clinically important difference in the proportion of responders between the CrA group (57.0{\%}) and the placebo group (46.0{\%}; P = .12) was observed. In addition, the maximum percent reduction in DEX dose achieved during the double-blind 12-week study was significantly greater in the CrA group (62.7{\%}) than in placebo group (51.4{\%}; P {\textless} .001). Patients receiving CrA demonstrated an improvement in myopathy and were less likely to develop signs of Cushing syndrome. CONCLUSIONCrA enables a reduction in steroid requirement for patients with PBE and is associated with a reduction in the incidence and severity of common steroid adverse effects, including myopathy.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE In total laryngectomy, the neopharynx can be closed in several ways. It is suggested that a pseudo-diverticulum is seen more frequently in patients closed with vertical closure than with "T"-shaped closure, causing postoperative dysphagia. We report the results of patients treated with vertical closure and "T"-shaped closure with regard to the formation of a pseudo-diverticulum and postoperative dysphagia. METHODS In our retrospective cohort study, we identified 117 consecutive laryngectomized patients treated in the VU University Medical Center of Amsterdam between March 2009 and December 2013. Evaluations with statistical analysis of postoperative outcome measures (the formation of a pseudo-diverticulum and dysphagia), qualitative and quantitative variables were conducted. RESULTS Patient demographics were similar between the vertical-shaped closure and the "T"-shaped closure groups. In 84.6{\%} of patients with vertical closure, a pseudo-diverticulum was seen compared to 18.5{\%} with "T"-shaped closure (p {\textless} 0.001). Dysphagia was increasingly seen in patients with a pseudo-diverticulum (60.5{\%}) compared to patients without a pseudo-diverticulum (39.5{\%}) (p = 0.090). CONCLUSION Formation of a pseudo-diverticulum is more frequently seen in laryngectomy patients closed with vertical closure than in patients closed with "T"-shaped closure of the neopharynx. It is favorable to implement "T"-shaped closure in laryngectomy.},

abstract = {Changes in model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score of {\textgreater}5 points over 30 days (delta-MELD) is an independent predictor for death in patients awaiting liver transplantation. The aim of the current study was to determine if a positive change in MELD score occurring over the 30 days immediately prior to liver transplantation was predictive of posttransplant mortality. MELD scores from the day of transplantation and 30 days prior to transplantation were calculated for 1510 UNOS patients and used to compute a delta-MELD score. Multivariate modeling determined predictors of posttransplant mortality. Patients with a pre-operative delta-MELD ≥ 5 had higher absolute MELD scores at transplant, shorter mean posttransplant survival and higher mortality. However, multivariate analysis showed that none of the excess mortality was attributable to the high delta-MELD score (p = 0.43 for delta-MELD ≥ 5) and the majority of the excess risk was attributable to absolute MELD score (p {\textless} 0.001) at the time of transplantation. Mortality of patients with rapidly worsening chronic liver disease who undergo transplantation depends substantially on absolute MELD score at the time of transplantation but not the rate of change immediately preceding transplant. Allocation policymakers should consider that a high delta-MELD in the immediate pretransplant period does not indicate greater posttransplant mortality.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: Liver transplantation for patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) with 3 or more failing organs (ACLF-3) is controversial. We compared liver waitlist mortality or removal according to model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score vs ACLF category. We also studied factors associated with reduced odds of survival for 1 year after liver transplantation in patients with ACLF-3. Methods: We analyzed data from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) from 2005 through 2016. We identified patients who were on the waitlist (100,594) and those who received liver transplants (50,552). Patients with ACLF were identified based on the European Association for the Study of the Liver-chronic liver failure criteria. Outcomes were evaluated with competing risks regression, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox proportional hazards regression. Results: Patients with ACLF-3 were more likely to die or be removed from the waitlist, regardless of MELD-sodium (MELD-Na) score, compared with the other ACLF groups; the proportion was greatest for patients with an ACLF-3 score and MELD-Na score below 25 (43.8{\%} at 28 days). Mechanical ventilation at liver transplantation (hazard ratio [HR] 1.49; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 1.22–1.84), donor risk index above 1.7 (HR 1.22; 95{\%} CI 1.09–1.35), and liver transplantation within 30 days of listing (HR 0.89; 95{\%} CI 0.81–0.98) were independently associated with survival for 1 year after liver transplantation Conclusions: In an analysis of data from the UNOS registry, we found high mortality among patients with ACLF-3 on the liver transplant waitlist, even among those with lower MELD-Na scores. So, certain patients with ACLF-3 have poor outcomes regardless of MELD-Na score. Liver transplantation increases odds of survival for these patients, particularly if performed within 30 days of placement on the waitlist. Mechanical ventilation at liver transplantation and use of marginal organs were associated with increased risk of death.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Pharyngocutaneous fistula (PCF) is the most common postoperative complication after total laryngectomy. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between PCF with pharyngeal repair time and the number of mucosal sutures. METHODS: The medical records of 47 patients who underwent total laryngectomy were assessed prospectively. The pharyngeal repair time and the number of horizontal, vertical, and cricopharyngeal muscle sutures were recorded. We observed the occurrence of PCF in 14 patients (29.8{\%}). The mean time for pharyngeal repair in the PCF group was 22 minutes 59 seconds +/- 5 minutes, and the mean number of vertical, horizontal, and cricopharyngeal muscle sutures was 8.57 +/- 2.6, 11.14 +/- 2.1, and 8.45 +/- 1.9, respectively. The mean time for pharyngeal repair in the non-PCF group was 22 minutes 21 seconds +/- 5 minutes, and the mean number of vertical, horizontal, and cricopharyngeal muscle sutures was 9.54 +/- 2.6, 10.84 +/- 2.3, and 7.36 +/- 2.7, respectively. The differences in the pharyngeal repair time and the number of vertical, horizontal, and cricopharyngeal sutures between the 2 groups were not statistically significant (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Besides, there was no statistically significant difference between the mean suture counts per centimeter in horizontal plane (1.46 +/- 0.35) and vertical plane (0.98 +/- 0.25) in the PCF group and the mean suture counts per centimeter in horizontal plane (1.42 +/- 0.37) and vertical plane (1.13 +/- 0.3) in the non-PCF group (P {\textgreater} 0.05).

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: Since February 27, 2002, patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have received priority for liver transplantation in the United States under the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) allocation system. We aimed to determine the impact of this system on liver transplantation for HCC. Methods: Data were provided by the United Network for Organ Sharing on 19,404 first-time, cadaveric, adult liver transplantations performed in the United States between 2002 and 2007 and 15,906 performed between 1997 and 2002, an equal-duration period immediately preceding the MELD allocation system. Results: In 1997-2002, 4.6{\%} of liver transplant recipients had HCC compared with 26{\%} in 2002-2007, the majority of whom received "HCC-MELD-exceptions" allowing expedited transplantation. Posttransplantation survival of patients with HCC without an "HCC-MELD-exception" was significantly worse than the survival of patients without HCC. In 2002-2007, patients with an "HCC-MELD-exception" had similar survival to patients without HCC. However, for the subgroup of patients with tumors 3-5 cm in size had significantly worse survival. When compared with patients with similar MELD scores, patients in the "HCC-MELD-exception" group had worse posttransplantation survival than patients without HCC. The most important predictors of poor posttransplantation survival were MELD score ≥20 (hazard ratio, 1.61; 95{\%} CI: 1.3-2.1) and serum $\alpha$-fetoprotein level ≥455 ng/mL (hazard ratio, 2.15; 95{\%} CI: 1.5-2.0). Conclusions: The adoption of the MELD allocation system has led to a 6-fold increase in the proportion of transplantation patients with HCC. Patients with larger (3-5 cm) tumors, serum $\alpha$-fetoprotein level ≥455 ng/mL, or a MELD score ≥20 have poor posttransplantation survival. {\textcopyright} 2008 AGA Institute.},

abstract = {Disease populations, clinical practice, and healthcare systems are constantly evolving. This can result in clinical prediction models quickly becoming outdated and less accurate over time. A potential solution is to develop ‘dynamic' prediction models capable of retaining accuracy by evolving over time in response to observed changes. Our aim was to review the literature in this area to understand the current state-of-the-art in dynamic prediction modelling and identify unresolved methodological challenges. MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science were searched for papers which used or developed dynamic clinical prediction models. Information was extracted on methods for model updating, choice of update windows and decay factors and validation of models. We also extracted reported limitations of methods and recommendations for future research. We identified eleven papers that discussed seven dynamic clinical prediction modelling methods which split into three categories. The first category uses frequentist methods to update models in discrete steps, the second uses Bayesian methods for continuous updating and the third, based on varying coefficients, explicitly describes the relationship between predictors and outcome variable as a function of calendar time. These methods have been applied to a limited number of healthcare problems, and few empirical comparisons between them have been made. Dynamic prediction models are not well established but they overcome one of the major issues with static clinical prediction models, calibration drift. However, there are challenges in choosing decay factors and in dealing with sudden changes. The validation of dynamic prediction models is still largely unexplored terrain.},

abstract = {Background: To clarify the factors associated with post-hepatectomy surgical site infections (SSIs), the clinicopathological data of 526 patients who underwent hepatectomy was retrospectively examined as a retrospectively cohort study. Methods: Patient demographics, liver functions, histological findings, surgical records and post-hepatectomy morbidity were compared between non-SSI and SSI groups; the SSI group included superficial and deep SSIs. Results: The prevalence of SSIs (5-8{\%}) has not changed over an 18-year period. Deep SSIs were significantly more increased in male patients with lower performance statuses and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores (p {\textless} 0.05). SSIs tended to be less prevalent, although not significant (p = 0.10), in patients who underwent laparoscopic hepatectomies compared to those who underwent laparotomies. For patients in whom hemostatic devices were used, the prevalence of superficial SSIs was significantly lower than those in whom the devices were not used (p {\textless} 0.05). Blood loss and transfusion were significantly more frequent in the deep SSI group compared to other groups (p {\textless} 0.01). Hospital stay in the deep SSI group was significantly longer compared to other groups. The incidence of morbidity was more frequent in the SSI groups compared with the non-SSI group (p {\textless} 0.001). A multivariate analysis showed that not using a vessel sealing device was significantly associated with superficial SSIs; male gender, hepatic failure and bile leakage were significantly associated with deep SSIs (p {\textless} 0.05). Conclusions: SSIs were important indicators of patient outcomes after hepatectomies, and preventing SSI development after surgical procedures is an important step in improving the overall prevalence of SSIs. {\textcopyright} 2014 Surgical Associates Ltd.},

abstract = {Vocal function was assessed in 15 patients who received thyroplasty type I for the rehabilitation of unilateral vocal fold paralysis. The function was assessed by perceptual evaluation, voice intensity and frequency range profiles, and questionnaire. Goals of the study were to evaluate the efficacy of thyroplasty in improving the voice, to compare postoperative thyroplasty voices to normal voices, and to correlate objective measurements to the results of the questionnaire regarding satisfaction with the voice. Perceptual evaluations were performed by randomizing normal and thyroplasty voices on a recording tape. The voices on the tape were then rated by independent, blinded, trained listeners. The perceptual qualities of pitch, intonation, and loudness were not statistically different than normals; however, voice qualities of strain, breathiness, hoarseness, harshness, and unsteadiness were different than normals. Mean frequency range and mean intensity range were moderately to severely reduced from normals with a wide variation being present in the results. The correlation between the higher threshold phonation pressures and decreased intensity ranges found in some patients is discussed. Questionnaire results indicated that a high degree of satisfaction with the surgery was present (92{\%}). Extreme or general satisfaction with voice was present in 73{\%}. The most difficult voicing was experienced at work, with 25{\%} needing to adjust their employment to accommodate their voice abilities. These results indicate that thyroplasty type I is effective in partially rehabilitating unilateral voice fold paralysis. Voice function is still not normal, probably in part due to the underlying disease.},

abstract = {The voice range profile (VRP) is a display of vocal intensity range versus fundamental frequency (F0). Past measurements have shown that the intensity range is reduced at the extremes of the F0 range, that there is a gradual upward tilt of the high- and low-intensity boundaries with increasing F0, and that a ripple exists at the boundaries. The intensity ripple, which results from tuning of source harmonics to the formants, is more noticeable at the upper boundary than the lower boundary because higher harmonics are not energized as effectively near phonation threshold as at maximum lung pressure. The gradual tilt of the intensity boundaries results from more effective transmission and radiation of acoustic energy at higher fundamental frequencies. This depends on the spectral distribution of the source power, however, At low F0, a smaller spectral slope (more harmonic energy) produces greater intensity. At high F0, on the other hand, a shift of energy toward the fundamental results in greater intensity. This dependence of intensity on spectral distribution of source power seems to explain the reduced intensity range at higher F0. An unrelated problem of reduced intensity range at low F0 stems from the inherent difficulty of keeping F0 from rising when subglottal pressure is increased.},

The predisposing factors are not clearly identified, but prior radiotherapy seems to increase the risk of fistulae. The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the value of the pectoralis myofascial flap in pharyngeal reconstruction in post-radiotherapy total laryngectomy in order to decrease the risk of fistula formation. The charts of 60 consecutive patients who had undergone total laryngectomy or pharyngolaryngectomy after radiotherapy were analyzed. Twenty-one variables were recorded for each patient. The overall rate of fistula formation was 38{\%} (23{\%} when a pectoralis myofascial flap was used to cover the pharynx and 50{\%} when no flap was used, P = 0.06). The flap-related complications were exceptional. In the subgroup of patients with diabetes mellitus, a history of vascular disease or a poor nutritional status, the use of a flap reduced the fistula formation from 73 to 13{\%} (P = 0.018). The pectoralis myofascial flap covering the pharyngeal sutures in postradiotherapy laryngectomy is particularly useful in a selected group of patients (with diabetes mellitus, history of vascular disease or poor nutritional status).},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the technique of combined Gore-Tex medialization thyroplasty with arytenoid adduction and to determine the long-term vocal outcome of patients treated for unilateral vocal cord paralysis with this procedure. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective chart review and patient reevaluation for patients treated at The University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics between May 1995 and June 1999. METHODS: The review addressed patient demographics, perioperative and long-term complications, and voice outcomes. Details of the surgical technique are provided within the manuscript. RESULTS: Seventy-two Gore-Tex medialization procedures were completed. Arytenoid adduction was included in 22 of these procedures. This subset of patients was compared with the patients treated with Gore-Tex alone. No major postoperative complications occurred in either group. Preoperative and postoperative voice and videostroboscopy data were available for 19 arytenoid adduction patients and 25 Gore-Tex alone patients. On a seven-point scale (6 [severely abnormal] --{\textgreater} 0 [normal voice]), the average patient rating of voice dysfunction improved from 4.2 to 1.6 (arytenoid adduction) and 4.5 to 2.8 (Gore-Tex alone). Maximum phonation time improved from 6.9 seconds to 16.7 seconds in the arytenoid adduction group. Subjective voice assessment employing the four-point GRBAS scale (3 [severely abnormal] --{\textgreater} 0 [normal]) identified average improvement from an overall grade of 2.1 to 0.8 arytenoid adduction and 2.2 to 1.5 in the Gore-Tex alone group. Improvement was identified in the vocal quality of breathiness from 1.9 to 0.2 (arytenoid adduction) and 1.9 to 0.9 (Gore-Tex alone). CONCLUSIONS: The combined technique of Gore-Tex medialization thyroplasty and arytenoid adduction provide functional results that appear to exceed the improvement attained with medialization alone.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Total laryngectomy is a recognised treatment for advanced laryngeal carcinoma. Traditionally, pharyngeal repair is performed with layered sutures. We describe our experience with a technique of closed pharyngoplasty using a linear stapler device. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten total laryngectomies were performed from July 2002 to July 2004, using an Ethicon TLC 75 linear stapler for pharyngeal closure. Data collected included age, sex, staging, endoscopic assessment, surgical margins and post-operative course (including complications and swallowing). RESULTS: Patients comprised eight men and two women. The mean age was 55.4 years. Six patients had stage T4 endolaryngeal carcinoma and four had stage T3. Four patients underwent pre-operative radiotherapy. Clear surgical margins were achieved in all patients. One patient developed a pharyngocutaneous fistula. Patients resumed oral intake at 48 hours, or at 72 hours if they had undergone pre-operative radiotherapy. Patients' mean hospital stay was seven days. CONCLUSION: This stapled closed technique for pharyngoplasty is efficient and eliminates the risk of wound contamination, thus theoretically reducing the risk of tumour seeding. In addition, we were able to commence patients on oral fluids at a mean of 48 hours after surgery. The mean hospital stay was seven days. We recommend this technique as an alternative for repairing the pharynx in patients undergoing total laryngectomy for endolaryngeal carcinoma.},

Methods for testing and visualizing calibration (e.g. the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and calibration slope) have been well thought out in the binary regression setting. However, extension of these methods to Cox models is less well known and could be improved. We describe a model-based framework for the assessment of calibration in the binary setting that provides natural extensions to the survival data setting. We show that Poisson regression models can be used to easily assess calibration in prognostic models. In addition, we show that a calibration test suggested for use in survival data has poor performance. Finally, we apply these methods to the problem of external validation of a risk score developed for the general population when assessed in a special patient population (i.e. patients with particular comorbidities, such as rheumatoid arthritis).},

To allow timely transplantation, pediatric recipients are allocated by an assigned pediatric MELD independent of severity of illness. Consequences for children listed at our center were evaluated by retrospective analysis of all primary pediatric liver transplantation (LTX) from deceased donors between 2002 and 2010 (110 LTX before/50 LTX after new allocation). Of 50 children transplanted in the MELD era, 17 (34{\%}) underwent LTX with a high-urgent status that was real in five patients (median lab MELD 22, waiting time five d) and assigned in 12 patients (lab MELD 7, waiting time 35 d). Thirty-three children received a liver by their assigned pediatric MELD (lab MELD 15, waiting time 255 d). Waiting time in the two periods was similar, whereas the wait-list mortality decreased (from about four children/yr to about one child/yr). One- and three-yr patient survival showed no significant difference (94.5/97.7{\%}; p = 0.385) as did one- and three-yr graft survival (80.7/75.2{\%}; and 86.5/82{\%}; p = 0.436 before/after).

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims Patients with T2 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can obtain an exception that allows them to undergo liver transplantation with much lower actual Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores than patients without HCC. We compared patients who received liver transplants, with and without HCC, with regard to transplantation-related survival benefit. Methods We modeled the post-transplantation survival of adult, first-time liver transplant recipients with HCC (n = 9135) or without (n = 25,890) from 2002 through 2013 using Cox proportional hazards regression. We modeled waitlist survival of patients listed for transplantation with HCC (n = 15,605) or without (n = 85,229) using competing risks analysis and combined outcomes of death or liver failure (defined as MELD score ≥30). We used these survival models to calculate monthly transition probabilities and 5-year life expectancies. Survival benefit was calculated as the difference between post-transplantation and waitlist life expectancy. Results The 5-year survival benefit increased with actual MELD score for patients with and without HCC, ranging from just a few months in patients with low MELD scores (ie, 6-8) to 4 years in patients with the highest MELD scores (ie, 36-40). The survival benefit of patients with HCC was similar to that of patients without HCC who had the same actual MELD score, irrespective of tumor burden or serum level of $\alpha$-fetoprotein. However, because patients with HCC received liver transplants when they had a lower mean MELD score (13.3 ± 6.2) than patients without HCC (21.8 ± 8.0), a much lower mean 5-year survival benefit was achieved by providing liver transplants to patients with HCC (0.12 years/patient) than patients without HCC (1.47 years/patient). Conclusions The HCC MELD exception policy has unintentionally resulted in a large reduction in transplantation-related survival benefit.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate need for antibiotic prophylaxis for radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of liver tumors in patients with no significant co-existing risk factors for infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2004 to September 2013, 83 patients underwent 123 percutaneous RFA procedures for total of 152 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lesions. None of the patients had pre-existing biliary enteric anastomosis (BEA) or any biliary tract abnormality predisposing to ascending biliary infection or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. No pre- or post-procedure antibiotic prophylaxis was provided for 121 procedures. Data for potential risk factors were reviewed retrospectively and analyzed for the frequency of infectious complications, including abscess formation. RESULTS: One patient (1/121 (0.8{\%}) RFA sessions) developed a large segment 5 liver abscess/infected biloma communicating with the gallbladder 7 weeks after the procedure, successfully treated over 10 weeks with IV and PO antibiotic therapy and percutaneous catheter drainage. This patient did not receive any antibiotics prior to RFA. During the procedure, there was inadvertent placement of RFA probe tines into the gallbladder. No other infectious complications were documented. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the routine use of prophylactic antibiotics for liver RFA is not necessary in majority of the patients undergoing liver ablation for HCC and could be limited to patients with high-risk factors such as the presence of BEA or other biliary abnormalities, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and large centrally located tumors in close proximity to central bile ducts. Larger randomized studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.},

OBJECTIVE: To perform the first population-based, time series analysis of the epidemiology, management, and outcomes of ELT using an 11-state, inpatient sample database containing more than 54 million patients. PATIENTS: Three hundred ninety-two patients with a primary or secondary diagnosis of ELT were identified. Over a 5-year period, the incidence of ELT in this series was 1/137,000. The mean (+/-SD) age was 37 (+/-7) years, and the overall mortality rate was 2.04{\%}. Two hundred forty-eight patients required surgical intervention. RESULTS: The average length of stay for 67 patients not requiring surgical intervention for any injury was 3 (+/-2) days, with no mortality. One hundred eighty patients underwent endoscopy, with 14 requiring tracheotomy alone and 57 requiring tracheotomy plus laryngeal repair. The average length of stay and the mortality rate were higher in these latter groups. Overall, 139 patients underwent tracheotomy, with a mortality rate of 5{\%}, while 96 patients underwent laryngeal repair, with a mortality rate of 1{\%}. Surgical treatment was performed in 140 patients with ELT within 24 hours after presentation, while another 60 received treatment within 48 hours. Associated injuries included skull base or intracranial injury (13{\%}), open neck injury (9{\%}), cervical spine injury (8{\%}), and esophageal or pharyngeal injury (3{\%}). CONCLUSION: External laryngeal trauma is a rare injury, with most patients requiring surgical intervention.},

abstract = {Although the terms "breathy" and "rough" are frequently applied to pathological voices, widely accepted definitions are not available and the relationship between these qualities is not understood. To investigate these matters, expert listeners judged the dissimilarity of pathological voices with respect to breathiness and roughness. A second group of listeners rated the voices on unidimensional scales for the same qualities. Multidimensional scaling analyses suggested that breathiness and roughness are related, multidimensional constructs. Unidimensional ratings of both breathiness and roughness were necessary to describe patterns of similarity with respect to either quality. Listeners differed in the relative importance given to different aspects of voice quality, particularly when judging roughness. The presence of roughness in a voice did not appear to influence raters' judgments of breathiness; however, judgments of roughness were heavily influenced by the degree of breathiness, the particular nature of the influence varying from listener to listener. Differences in how listeners focus their attention on the different aspects of multidimensional perceptual qualities apparently are a significant source of interrater unreliability (noise) in voice quality ratings.},

@article{Storck2011,
abstract = {Objectives/Hypothesis: Laryngeal framework surgery requires a good understanding of the biomechanics of the cricoarytenoid (CA) joint, the precise function of which is still only poorly understood. The aim of the study was (1) to show that, by superimposing two or more three-dimensional (3D) images, we can visualize the exact position of the arytenoid cartilages within the larynx at different phases of their movement; and (2) to demonstrate that it is possible to analyze the arytenoid cartilage movements mathematically with the help of vector analysis. Study Design: In vitro cadaver study. Methods: Twenty fresh and intact cadaver larynges were scanned by high-resolution computerized tomography with the arytenoid cartilages in "respiratory" position and in "phonatory" position. The two positions were superimposed and rendered in 3D with MIMICS (Materialise Interactive Medical Image Control System, Leuven, Belgium). The spatial trajectory of the arytenoid cartilage movements was calculated with vector analysis. Results: The movement from the "respiratory" to the "phonatory" position has three components: (1) an inward rocking action around the longitudinal CA joint; (2) a forward sliding movement along the longitudinal axis of the CA joint; and (3) an inward rotation around a virtual axis that runs perpendicular to the CA joint axis. Conclusions: Superimposing 3D images of the larynx with the help of the software package MIMICS allows us to visualize and to analyze mathematically the trajectory of the arytenoid cartilage. The arytenoid cartilages rock inward, slide forward, and rotate inward when they move from the "respiratory" to the "phonatory" position. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Voice Foundation.},

abstract = {Peri-operative SARS-CoV-2 infection increases postoperative mortality. The aim of this study was to determine the optimal duration of planned delay before surgery in patients who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection. This international, multicentre, prospective cohort study included patients undergoing elective or emergency surgery during October 2020. Surgical patients with pre-operative SARS-CoV-2 infection were compared with those without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary outcome measure was 30-day postoperative mortality. Logistic regression models were used to calculate adjusted 30-day mortality rates stratified by time from diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection to surgery. Among 140,231 patients (116 countries), 3127 patients (2.2{\%}) had a pre-operative SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Adjusted 30-day mortality in patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection was 1.5{\%} (95{\%}CI 1.4–1.5). In patients with a pre-operative SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, mortality was increased in patients having surgery within 0–2 weeks, 3–4 weeks and 5–6 weeks of the diagnosis (odds ratio (95{\%}CI) 4.1 (3.3–4.8), 3.9 (2.6–5.1) and 3.6 (2.0–5.2), respectively). Surgery performed ≥ 7 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis was associated with a similar mortality risk to baseline (odds ratio (95{\%}CI) 1.5 (0.9–2.1)). After a ≥ 7 week delay in undertaking surgery following SARS-CoV-2 infection, patients with ongoing symptoms had a higher mortality than patients whose symptoms had resolved or who had been asymptomatic (6.0{\%} (95{\%}CI 3.2–8.7) vs. 2.4{\%} (95{\%}CI 1.4–3.4) vs. 1.3{\%} (95{\%}CI 0.6–2.0), respectively). Where possible, surgery should be delayed for at least 7 weeks following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients with ongoing symptoms ≥ 7 weeks from diagnosis may benefit from further delay.},

The objective of the study was to assess the oncologic outcomes and life quality of TLM in comparison with RT for T1 glottic carcinoma. We searched Medline/PubMed, Web of knowledge, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Wiley online library, Springer, Google, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), etc. We screened the literature, assessed the quality of the studies, and extracted the relevant data through the establishment of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Meta-analysis was done using the Cochrane collaboration' s RevMan 5.0 for data analysis. A total of 11 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The laryngeal preservation for patients undergoing TLM was significantly better than that for RT (P {\textless} 0.00). The laser surgery significantly improved the overall survival of patients with T1 glottic carcinoma (P = 0.04). No statistically significant differences were found between TLM and RT regarding the local control (P = 0.91). The funnel plot demonstrates no apparent publication bias in the overall survival and laryngeal preservation comparison. Our meta-analysis suggested that laser surgery was a preferred method than radiotherapy with respect to significantly better overall survival and laryngeal preservation. But the local control was not significant different. Further prospective randomized controlled studies will be needed.},

From Duplicate 46 (Primary and Salvage Total Laryngectomy - Agrawal, Nishant; Goldenberg, David)

Gebruikt voor indicaties noemen in introductie protocol. Primary TL is indicated in advanced disease that is not amenable to partial laryngectomy, concurrent chemoradiation, or radiotherapy alone. Specifically, tumors that have penetrated through cartilage, invasion into the extralaryngeal soft tissue of the neck, and extensive involvement of the base of tongue are suitable for this procedure. Non-neoplastic indications for primary TL include laryngeal dysfunction with life-threatening aspiration or chondro-radionecrosis of the larynx. Also, pulmonary status and medical comorbidities and cognitive function may define the treatment options for a given patient. Salvage TL is indicated for chemoradiation, radiation, or partial laryngeal surgical failures. Salvage laryngectomy was required in 16{\%} of patients treated with concurrent chemoradiation and 31{\%} of patients treated with radiotherapy alone [8]. Salvage TL can be technically more difficult and carries a higher postoperative complication rate.},

abstract = {Objectives Voice prosthesis is the standard of care for postlaryngectomy voice rehabilitation. We aimed to assess functional outcomes of Provox voice prosthesis, to study the impact of several clinical factors (timing of Provox insertion, type of pharyngeal closure, requirement of reconstruction, performance of myotomy, and radiotherapy) on the functional outcomes, and to record the complications associated with Provox voice prosthesis. Study Design Prospective nonrandomized cross-sectional observational study. Methods Thirty patients with postlaryngectomy speech rehabilitation with Provox prosthesis were studied. After the procedure, the patients were evaluated by a speech-language pathologist and assessed at immediate postoperative period and 6-month and 1-year interval using the parameters of functional outcomes GRBAS scale, maximal phonatory duration (MPD), and words per breath (WPB). SPSS Version 19 was used for statistical analysis. Results All patients had average good voice at the end of 1 year after Provox insertion with voice quality results improving with time. Number of patients having MPD more than 7 was 21, 29, and 30 at 0 months, 6 months, and 1 year, respectively. At the end of 1 year, 11 patients had WPB score between 15 and 19. Seven patients had complications: periprosthetic leak (4), central leak (1), hypertonic segment (1), and stricture of the neopharynx (1). Primary Provox insertion, nonrequirement of postoperative radiation, cricopharyngeal myotomy, and primary and vertical closure of neopharynx had a better influence on the outcome; however, the results were not statistically significant. Conclusions Provox voice prosthesis provides consistent and good voice results, which improve with time. Periprosthetic leak is the most common complication.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Voice disorders affect patients profoundly, and acoustic tools can potentially measure voice function objectively. Disordered sustained vowels exhibit wide-ranging phenomena, from nearly periodic to highly complex, aperiodic vibrations, and increased "breathiness". Modelling and surrogate data studies have shown significant nonlinear and non-Gaussian random properties in these sounds. Nonetheless, existing tools are limited to analysing voices displaying near periodicity, and do not account for this inherent biophysical nonlinearity and non-Gaussian randomness, often using linear signal processing methods insensitive to these properties. They do not directly measure the two main biophysical symptoms of disorder: complex nonlinear aperiodicity, and turbulent, aeroacoustic, non-Gaussian randomness. Often these tools cannot be applied to more severe disordered voices, limiting their clinical usefulness. METHODS This paper introduces two new tools to speech analysis: recurrence and fractal scaling, which overcome the range limitations of existing tools by addressing directly these two symptoms of disorder, together reproducing a "hoarseness" diagram. A simple bootstrapped classifier then uses these two features to distinguish normal from disordered voices. RESULTS On a large database of subjects with a wide variety of voice disorders, these new techniques can distinguish normal from disordered cases, using quadratic discriminant analysis, to overall correct classification performance of 91.8 +/- 2.0{\%}. The true positive classification performance is 95.4 +/- 3.2{\%}, and the true negative performance is 91.5 +/- 2.3{\%} (95{\%} confidence). This is shown to outperform all combinations of the most popular classical tools. CONCLUSION Given the very large number of arbitrary parameters and computational complexity of existing techniques, these new techniques are far simpler and yet achieve clinically useful classification performance using only a basic classification technique. They do so by exploiting the inherent nonlinearity and turbulent randomness in disordered voice signals. They are widely applicable to the whole range of disordered voice phenomena by design. These new measures could therefore be used for a variety of practical clinical purposes.},

abstract = {Abstract Objective. To identify patterns of failure following transcervi- cal medialization laryngoplasty for unilateral vocal fold paralysis and describe indications and revision techniques for optimal vocal outcomes. Study Design. Case series with chart review. Setting. Tertiary care center. Subjects and Methods. Thirty-nine consecutive patients between January 2005 and April 2014 undergoing transcer- vical revision of failed primary medialization laryngoplasty were identified. Demographics, etiology, stroboscopic assessment, and surgical techniques were recorded. Patient self-assessment using the Voice-Related Quality-of-Life (VRQOL) questionnaire and objective acoustic and aerody- namic assessments performed pre- and postoperatively were analyzed using t tests for paired comparisons. Results. Thirty-nine patients underwent 48 transcervical revision surgeries. Median follow-up was 14.6 months from time of final revision surgery. Indications included anterior glottic incompe- tence (38/48, 79{\%}), posterior glottic incompetence (20/48, 42{\%}), glottic overclosure (8/48, 17{\%}), and/or decreased phona- tory pliability (12/48, 25{\%}). A combination of findings was pres- ent in 21 (44{\%}) surgeries. Revision techniques included either anterior augmentation, arytenopexy, and cricothyroid subluxa- tion (alone or in combination) in 46 of 48 (96{\%}) patients or par- tial implant removal alone in 2 patients. Seven patients (18{\%}) required multiple revisions. A complete set of voice parameters was available for 22 patients, and statistically significant improve- ments included VRQOL scores, fundamental frequency in females, jitter, noise-to-harmonic ratio, and mean airflow rate. Conclusion. Patterns of failure in patients with suboptimal phonatory function after transcervical medialization laryngo- plasty included persistent glottic incompetence, glottic over- closure, and decreased vocal fold pliability. Revision transcervical medialization surgery, guided by individualized consideration of vocal fold position and surface pliability, can improve phonatory outcomes.},

abstract = {QUESTION: Do steroids improve neurologic symptoms in patients with metastatic brain tumors compared to no treatment? If steroids are given, what dose should be used? Comparisons include: (1) steroid therapy versus none. (2) comparison of different doses of steroid therapy. TARGET POPULATION: These recommendations apply to adults diagnosed with brain metastases. RECOMMENDATIONS: Steroid therapy versus no steroid therapy Asymptomatic brain metastases patients without mass effect Insufficient evidence exists to make a treatment recommendation for this clinical scenario. Brain metastases patients with mild symptoms related to mass effect Level 3 Corticosteroids are recommended to provide temporary symptomatic relief of symptoms related to increased intracranial pressure and edema secondary to brain metastases. It is recommended for patients who are symptomatic from metastatic disease to the brain that a starting dose of 4-8 mg/day of dexamethasone be considered. Brain metastases patients with moderate to severe symptoms related to mass effect Level 3 Corticosteroids are recommended to provide temporary symptomatic relief of symptoms related to increased intracranial pressure and edema secondary to brain metastases. If patients exhibit severe symptoms consistent with increased intracranial pressure, it is recommended that higher doses such as 16 mg/day or more be considered. Choice of Steroid Level 3 If corticosteroids are given, dexamethasone is the best drug choice given the available evidence. Duration of Corticosteroid Administration Level 3 Corticosteroids, if given, should be tapered slowly over a 2 week time period, or longer in symptomatic patients, based upon an individualized treatment regimen and a full understanding of the long-term sequelae of corticosteroid therapy. Given the very limited number of studies (two) which met the eligibility criteria for the systematic review, these are the only recommendations that can be offered based on this methodology. Please see "Discussion" and "Summary" section for additional details.},

abstract = {Currently, there is debate among the liver transplant community regarding the most appropriate mechanism for organ allocation: urgency-based (MELD) versus utility-based (survival benefit). We hypothesize that MELD and survival benefit are closely associated, and therefore, our current MELD-based allocation already reflects utility-based allocation. We used generalized gamma parametric models to quantify survival benefit of LT across MELD categories among 74 196 adult liver-only active candidates between 2006 and 2016 in the United States. We calculated time ratios (TR) of relative life expectancy with transplantation versus without and calculated expected life years gained after LT. LT extended life expectancy (TR {\textgreater} 1) for patients with MELD {\textgreater} 10. The highest MELD was associated with the longest relative life expectancy (TR = 1.05 1.20 1.37 for MELD 11-15, 2.29 2.49 2.70 for MELD 16-20, 5.30 5.72 6.16 for MELD 21-25, 15.12 16.35 17.67 for MELD 26-30; 39.26 43.21 47.55 for MELD 31-34; 120.04 128.25 137.02 for MELD 35-40). As a result, candidates with the highest MELD gained the most life years after LT: 0.2, 1.5, 3.5, 5.8, 6.9, 7.2 years for MELD 11-15, 16-20, 21-25, 26-30, 31-34, 35-40, respectively. Therefore, prioritizing candidates by MELD remains a simple, effective strategy for prioritizing candidates with a higher transplant survival benefit over those with lower survival benefit.},

Our model comprises two parts linked by shared latent terms. On the one hand is a multivariate mixed linear model with random effects, where a low-rank thin-plate spline function is incorporated to collect the nonlinear behavior of the different profiles over time. On the other hand is an infection-specific Cox model, where the dependence between different types of infections and the related times of infection is through a random effect associated with each infection type to catch the within dependence and a shared frailty parameter to capture the dependence between infection types. We implemented the parameterization used in joint models which uses the fitted longitudinal measurements as time-dependent covariates in a relative risk model.

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: Multiple organ failures (OFs) are common in patients with cirrhosis, but the independent effect of the number or type of OFs on liver transplantation (LT) outcomes is not well defined. Method: United Network for Organ Sharing data were analyzed from 2002 to 2016 for all adults listed for LT who received an LT within 30 days after listing. We estimated post-LT survival stratified by number and type of pre-transplant OFs before and after adjusting for confounding variables. Results: During the study period, 4,714 (4.1{\%}) patients died and 19,375 (16.6{\%}) patients were transplanted within 30 days of listing. One or more OF were more common in those who were transplanted (57.4{\%}) compared to those without LT (9.5{\%}). The probability of staying alive more than 30 days on the waiting list without LT decreased with increasing number of OFs; while 90{\%} were alive without OF, only 20{\%} were alive with two OFs, and 2–8{\%} with three or more OFs. The interval between listing and transplantation decreased with an increase in OFs, and the median time to transplant after listing was only 4–5 days with three or more OFs. Although the risk of post-LT mortality increased with increasing number of OFs, the 90-day patient survival was 90{\%} and one-year survival was 81{\%} in the presence of 5–6 OFs. The number of OFs was an independent predictor of survival, but the maximum difference in one-year graft or patient survival between those without OF and those with 5–6 OFs was only 9{\%}. Additionally, the type of OF had minimal impact on outcomes. Conclusions: Liver transplantation is feasible with excellent outcomes, even in the presence of five or six OFs. Lay summary: Multiple organ failures, ranging from 1–6, are common in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis. The survival without liver transplant is dismal in the presence of three or more organ failures. Small retrospective studies have shown that liver transplant is feasible with good outcomes even in the presence of multiple organ failures. In this study, using a large national dataset, we show that survival chances for more than 30 days in those with three or more organ failures are less than 8{\%}. However, if a liver transplant is performed quickly, the survival chances are very high with one-year survival ranging from 84{\%} with three organ failures to 81{\%} with 5–6 organ failures.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To report the long-term results of the Intergroup Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 91-11 study evaluating the contribution of chemotherapy added to radiation therapy (RT) for larynx preservation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with stage III or IV glottic or supraglottic squamous cell cancer were randomly assigned to induction cisplatin/fluorouracil (PF) followed by RT (control arm), concomitant cisplatin/RT, or RT alone. The composite end point of laryngectomy-free survival (LFS) was the primary end point. RESULTS: Five hundred twenty patients were analyzed. Median follow-up for surviving patients is 10.8 years. Both chemotherapy regimens significantly improved LFS compared with RT alone (induction chemotherapy v RT alone: hazard ratio [HR], 0.75; 95{\%} CI, 0.59 to 0.95; P = .02; concomitant chemotherapy v RT alone: HR, 0.78; 95{\%} CI, 0.78 to 0.98; P = .03). Overall survival did not differ significantly, although there was a possibility of worse outcome with concomitant relative to induction chemotherapy (HR, 1.25; 95{\%} CI, 0.98 to 1.61; P = .08). Concomitant cisplatin/RT significantly improved the larynx preservation rate over induction PF followed by RT (HR, 0.58; 95{\%} CI, 0.37 to 0.89; P = .0050) and over RT alone (P {\textless} .001), whereas induction PF followed by RT was not better than treatment with RT alone (HR, 1.26; 95{\%} CI, 0.88 to 1.82; P = .35). No difference in late effects was detected, but deaths not attributed to larynx cancer or treatment were higher with concomitant chemotherapy (30.8{\%} v 20.8{\%} with induction chemotherapy and 16.9{\%} with RT alone). CONCLUSION: These 10-year results show that induction PF followed by RT and concomitant cisplatin/RT show similar efficacy for the composite end point of LFS. Locoregional control and larynx preservation were significantly improved with concomitant cisplatin/RT compared with the induction arm or RT alone. New strategies that improve organ preservation and function with less morbidity are needed.},

The secondary outcome examined was posttreatment voice quality. DESIGN: Meta-analysis. METHOD: Systematic methods were used to identify published and unpublished data. Two reviewers screened all titles and abstracts for relevance and independently assessed all articles. All identified studies were retrospective. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Local control, overall survival, laryngectomy-free survival, and posttreatment voice quality. RESULTS: For oncologic control, case series were pooled as a composite group using a random effects model. The analysis was based on over 7600 patients. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. There were no significant differences between TOL surgery and XRT for local control (OR 0.81, 95{\%} CI 0.51-1.3) and laryngectomy-free survival (OR 0.73, 95{\%} CI 0.39-1.35). For overall survival, the analysis favoured TOL surgery (OR 1.48, 95{\%} CI 1.19-1.85). For voice quality, there were no objective differences; however, there was a trend toward superiority for XRT. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to examine the management of early glottic cancer using meta-analytic methodology. The analysis shows that although there is a trend favouring TOL surgery for overall survival, there is no clear difference in oncologic outcome between TOL surgery and XRT. However, there is a trend toward improved posttreatment voice quality with XRT. This is of questionable clinical significance as objective voice analyses often do not correlate with subjective assessments},

Widespread reliance on exceptions for pediatric recipients suggests that the 2 systems may not be comparable. Objective To evaluate the accuracy of the PELD score in estimating 90-day pretransplant mortality among pediatric patients on the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) waiting list. Design, Setting, and Participants Patients who were listed from February 27, 2002, to March 31, 2014, for primary liver transplant were included in this retrospective analysis and were followed up for at least 2 years through June 17, 2016. The study analyzed 2 cohorts using the UNOS Standard Transplant Analysis and Research data files. The full cohort comprised 4298 patients ({\textless}18 years of age) who had chronic liver disease (excluding cancer). The reduced cohort (n = 2421) excluded patients receiving living donor transplantation or PELD exception points. Main Outcomes and Measures Observed and expected 90-day pretransplant mortality rates evaluated at 10-point interval PELD levels. Results Among the 4298 patients in the full cohort (mean [SD] age, 2.5 [4.2] years; 2251 [52.4{\%}] female; 2201 [51.2{\%}] white), PELD scores and mortality were concordant (C statistic, 0.8387 [95{\%} CI, 0.8191-0.8584] for the full cohort and 0.8123 [95{\%} CI, 0.7919-0.8327] for the reduced cohort). However, the estimated 90-day mortality using the PELD score underestimated the actual probability of death by as much as 17{\%}. Conclusions and Relevance With use of the PELD score, the ranking of risk among children was preserved, but direct comparisons between adult and pediatric candidates were not accurate. Children with chronic liver disease who are in need of transplant may be at a disadvantage compared with adults in a similar situation.},

Outcomes were compared via Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall and disease-free survival were determined for T3 and T4a laryngeal cancers per treatment group.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A total of 727 laryngeal cancers were identified, and 258 were included. The mean follow-up was 3.43 years. Overall survival for T3 cancers at 2 and 5 years for TL-R/CT was 89{\%} and 70{\%}, for RT was 48{\%} and 18{\%}, and for CRT was 66{\%} and 52{\%}, respectively. The hazard ratios of RT and CRT compared to TL-R/CT were 3.1 (p {\textless} .001) and 2.6 (p = .004), respectively. Overall survival for T4a cancers at 2 and 5 years for TL-R/CT was 60{\%} and 49{\%}, for RT was 12{\%} and 5{\%}, and for CRT was 32{\%} and 16{\%}, respectively. The hazard ratios of RT and CRT compared to TL and RT were 4.9 (p {\textless} .001) and 2.3 (p = .04), respectively.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: TL-R/CT provides superior survival for T3 and T4a laryngeal cancers versus RT or CRT. Therefore, the current standards of care and clinical guidelines warrant reassessment.},

abstract = {The use of a stapler for pharyngeal closure during total laryngectomy was first described in 1971. It provides rapid watertight closure without surgical field contamination. The objective of our study was to compare the incidence of pharyngocutaneous fistula after total laryngectomy with manual and mechanical closures of the pharynx. This was a non-randomised, prospective clinical study conducted at two tertiary medical centres from 1996 to 2011 including consecutive patients with laryngeal tumours who underwent total laryngectomy. We compared the incidence of pharyngocutaneous fistula between two groups of patients: in 20 patients, 75 mm linear stapler closure was applied, whereas in 67 patients a manual suture was used. Clinical data were compared between groups. The groups were statistically similar in terms of gender, age, diabetes mellitus, smoking and alcohol consumption and tumour site. The group of patients who underwent stapler-assisted pharyngeal closure had a higher number of patients with previous tracheotomy (p {\textless} 0.001) and previous chemoradiation (p {\textless} 0.001). The incidence of pharyngocutaneous fistula was 30{\%} in the mechanical closure group and 20.9{\%} in the manual suture group (p = 0.42). In conclusion the use of the stapler does not increase the rate of fistulae.},

SETTING: Tertiary medical center. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Pharyngeal stenosis rates and risk factors were compared between two groups of laryngopharyngectomy patients: a group that underwent concurrent chemoradiation therapy followed by surgical salvage, and a surgery initiated group with adjuvant chemoradiation. RESULTS: Of 160 patients, 25 developed pharyngeal stenosis, which was diagnosed by barium esophagography with a pooling of barium contrast above the neopharyngeal inlet. These patients required nasogastric tube feeding or gastrostomy feeding because an oral liquid diet could not meet their nutritional needs. Primary closure and old age were risk factors for pharyngeal stenosis. Pharyngeal stenosis did not affect survival in patients with advanced hypopharyngeal cancer who underwent laryngopharyngectomy. CONCLUSION: Primary closure reconstruction is discouraged in patients over the age of 65 years.},

abstract = {The 'integrated discrimination improvement' (IDI) and the 'net reclassification index' (NRI) are statistics proposed as measures of the incremental prognostic impact that a new biomarker will have when added to an existing prediction model for a binary outcome. By design, both measures were meant to be intuitively appropriate, and the IDI and NRI formulae do look intuitively plausible. Both have become increasingly popular. We shall argue, however, that their use is not always safe. If IDI and NRI are used to measure gain in prediction performance, then poorly calibrated models may appear advantageous, and in a simulation study, even the model that actually generates the data (and hence is the best possible model) can be improved on without adding measured information. We illustrate these shortcomings in actual cancer data as well as by Monte Carlo simulations. In these examples, we contrast IDI and NRI with the area under ROC and the Brier score. Unlike IDI and NRI, these traditional measures have the characteristic that prognostic performance cannot be accidentally or deliberately inflated. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Objectives To evaluate the impact of time to treatment initiation (TTI) on overall survival in patients with head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Materials and methods In the period 2003–2009, 1616 HNSCC patients were diagnosed in Friuli Venezia Giulia Region, Northeastern Italy, including 462 oral, 346 oropharyngeal, 212 hypopharyngeal, and 596 laryngeal cancers. Clinical information, including date and type of first treatment, and follow-up were retrieved from the regional Cancer Registry and a population-based health database collecting comprehensive health information on people living in the Region. Multivariate hazard ratio (HR) and confidence intervals (CI) were calculated through Cox model. Results Overall, the median TTI was 28 days, (Q1-Q3: 13–45 days), but significant variations emerged according to anatomical site, cancer stage, treatment approach, and care transition to specialized centers. Five-year overall survival decreased with increasing treatment delay from 62{\%} for TTI {\textless} 30 days to 39{\%} for TTI ≥ 90 days (p {\textless} 0.01). HR of death was 1.13 (95{\%} CI: 0.92–1.39) for TTI between 45–89 days, and 1.47 (1.05–2.05) for TTI ≥ 90 days. The association between TTI and poor prognosis was stronger for laryngeal cancers and early-stage HNSCCs. Further, care transition from community hospitals to specialized centers was associated to a better prognosis (HR = 0.73; 95{\%} CI: 0.60–0.88). Conclusion Our study findings suggest that HNSCC patients treated within 45 days from diagnosis have increased survival probabilities and that early-stage patients suffered the most from treatment delay. Furthermore, care transition to specialized centers –though competitive to timely treatment– improves survival by providing the most innovative technologies and treatment approaches.},

abstract = {Background and Aims: There are limited data on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) growth patterns, particularly in Western cohorts, despite implications for surveillance, prognosis, and treatment. Our study's aim was to quantify tumor doubling time (TDT) and identify correlates associated with indolent and rapid growth. Approach and Results: We performed a retrospective multicenter cohort study of patients with cirrhosis diagnosed with HCC from 2008 to 2017 at six US and European health systems with two or more contrast-enhanced imaging studies performed ≥ 30 days apart prior to HCC treatment. Radiologists independently measured tumors in three dimensions to calculate TDT and specific growth rate (SGR). We used multivariable ordinal logistic regression to identify factors associated with indolent (TDT {\textgreater} 365 days) and rapid (TDT {\textless} 90 days) tumor growth. In the primary cohort (n = 242 patients from four centers), median TDT was 229 days (interquartile range [IQR], 89-627) and median SGR was 0.3{\%} per day (IQR, 0.1{\%}-0.8{\%}). Over one-third (38{\%}) of HCCs had indolent growth, 36.8{\%} intermediate growth, and 25.2{\%} rapid growth. In multivariable analysis, indolent growth was associated with larger tumor diameter (odds ratio [OR], 1.15, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.03–1.30) and alpha-fetoprotein {\textless} 20 ng/mL (OR, 1.90; 95{\%} CI, 1.12-3.21). Indolent growth was more common in nonviral than viral cirrhosis (50.9{\%} versus 32.1{\%}), particularly in patients with T1 HCC (OR, 3.41; 95{\%} CI, 1.08-10.80). Median TDT (169 days; IQR 74-408 days) and SGR (0.4{\%} per day) were similar in an independent cohort (n = 176 patients from two centers). Conclusions: In a large Western cohort of patients with HCC, we found heterogeneous tumor growth patterns, with one-fourth exhibiting rapid growth and over one-third having indolent growth. Better understanding different tumor growth patterns may facilitate a precision approach to prognostication and treatment.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine whether lower doses of dexamethasone for treatment of brain tumor edema are as effective as the conventional dose of 16 mg/d. We consecutively executed two double-blind randomized trials in patients with CT-proven brain metastasis and Karnofsky scores of 80 or less. In the first series, we compared 8 mg dexamethasone per day versus 16 mg/d; in the second series, 4 mg/d versus 16 mg/d. Standardized evaluation of quality of life and side effects took place at days 0, 7, 28, and 56. We randomized a total of 96 patients and evaluated eighty-nine. The Karnofsky score improved in the 8-mg group, which had improvement of 8.0 +/- 10.1 (mean +/- SD) points at day 7 versus 7.3 +/- 14.2 points in the 16-mg group. In the second series, the 4-mg group had improvement of 6.7 +/- 11.3 points at day 7 and 7.1 +/- 18.2 points at day 28 versus 9.1 +/- 12.4 and 5.6 +/- 18.5 points in the 16-mg group. Toxic effects occurred more frequently in the 16-mg group (p {\textless} 0.03). We conclude that administration of 4 mg dexamethasone per day for treatment of brain tumor edema results in the same degree of improvement as does administration of 16 mg/d after 1 week of treatment in patients who have no signs of impending herniation. Toxic effects are dose-dependent and, during a 4-week period, occurred more frequently in patients using 16 mg/d.},

This study is relied upon heavily in the systematic review and consensus reports summarized in the ‘‘Discussion'' section above [1, 7, 9]. However, the number of patients involved is relatively small and the study lacks a validation group; thus, despite the randomized design and ranking yielding a higher class of evidence, the recommendation itself is downgraded to reflect these concerns.

abstract = {Brain metastases are a common complication for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer and a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. In the past, treatment of brain metastases and lung cancer focused on symptom palliation with whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and steroids because of the grim outlook for patients. However, recent advances in technology and surgical techniques have created more options for the management of brain metastases, which include surgery, irradiation, stereotactic radiosurgery, and chemotherapy. These aggressive approaches have resulted in an improvement of neurologic outcomes and survival rates of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. Central nervous system (CNS) metastases can be divided into three groups: solitary CNS metastases with controlled or controllable primary disease, oligometastatic disease (fewer than 3 metastases), and multiple metastases. For patients with solitary CNS metastases, long-term survival is possible. A radical treatment approach involving surgical resection or radiosurgery, followed by WBRT, is recommended. For patients with oligometastatic disease, surgical resection or radiosurgery is considered in selected cases and WBRT is indicated. For patients with multiple metastases, WBRT is recommended. For patients with oligometastatic disease and those with multiple metastases, recent evidence indicates that systemically effective chemotherapy may produce responses and can be instituted safely before radiotherapy. The treatment timing of chemotherapy and radiotherapy should be individualized.},

The MELD is capped at 40 however, and patients with calculated MELD scores {\textgreater}40 are not prioritized despite increased mortality. We aimed to evaluate waitlist and post-transplant survival stratified by MELD to determine outcomes in patients with MELD {\textgreater}40. Methods Using United Network for Organ Sharing data, we identified patients listed for LT from February 2002 through to December 2012. Waitlist candidates with MELD ⩾40 were followed for 30 days or until the earliest occurrence of death or transplant. Results Of 65,776 waitlisted patients, 3.3{\%} had MELD ⩾40 at registration, and an additional 7.3{\%} had MELD scores increase to ⩾40 after waitlist registration. A total of 30,369 (46.2{\%}) underwent LT, of which 2,615 (8.6{\%}) had MELD ⩾40 at transplant. Compared to MELD 40, the hazard ratio of death within 30 days of registration was 1.4 (95{\%} CI 1.2–1.6) for patients with MELD 41–44, 2.6 (95{\%} CI 2.1–3.1) for MELD 45–49, and 5.0 (95{\%} CI 4.1–6.1) for MELD ⩾50. There was no difference in 1- and 3-year survival for patients transplanted with MELD {\textgreater}40 compared to MELD = 40. A survival benefit associated with LT was seen as MELD increased above 40. Conclusions Patients with MELD {\textgreater}40 have significantly greater waitlist mortality but comparable post-transplant outcomes to patients with MELD = 40 and, therefore, should be given priority for LT. Uncapping the MELD will allow more equitable organ distribution aligned with the principle of prioritizing patients most in need. Lay summary: In the United States (US), organs for liver transplantation are allocated by an objective scoring system called the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD), which aims to prioritize the sickest patients for transplant. The greater the MELD score, the greater the mortality without liver transplant. The MELD score, however, is artificially capped at 40 and thus actually disadvantages the sickest patients with end-stage liver disease. Analysis of the data advocates uncapping the MELD score to appropriately prioritize the patients most in need of a liver transplant.},

abstract = {Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is an increasingly recognised entity encompassing an acute deterioration of liver function in patients with cirrhosis, which is usually associated with a precipitating event and results in the failure of one or more organs and high short term mortality. Prospective data to define this is lacking but there is a large body of circumstantial evidence suggesting that this condition is a distinct clinical entity. From the pathophysiologic perspective, altered host response to injury and infection play important roles in its development.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Airway compromise arising from thyroplasty procedures including Isshiki type I through IV thyroplasties, arytenoid adduction, and arytenoid fixation is uncommon yet potentially life threatening. Identification of incidence of obstruction and probable causes is important for preoperative planning, consultation, and postoperative care. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of all thyroplasty operations, including arytenoid adduction and arytenoid fixation. METHODS: Three hundred thirty-two patients underwent a total of 630 thyroplasty procedures. Detailed information was gathered on patients manifesting symptoms of airway obstruction. RESULTS: Seven patients required an unplanned tracheostomy for airway compromise. Five of 143 patients who underwent arytenoid adduction required a tracheostomy, for an incidence of 3.5{\%}. The median interval to developing significant stridor requiring tracheostomy was 9 hours, with five of these seven patients requiring airway surgery within the first 18 postoperative hours. No patient receiving a type I thyroplasty alone developed significant airway compromise. Tracheostomy was required in two patients with underlying neuromuscular disease-one who underwent a bilateral type I thyroplasty and one who underwent an arytenoid fixation procedure. CONCLUSION: The percentage of airway complications after thyroplasty is low. However, arytenoid adduction and fixation operations have a significant risk of postoperative temporary tracheostomy and warrant preoperative discussion regarding tracheostomy and postoperative overnight hospital admission},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To test the total burden of complications in the early postoperative period after liver transplantation (LT) between donation after circulatory death (DCD) and donation after brain death (DBD) grafts with the novel Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI). BACKGROUND LT is complex surgery and the increasing use of high-risk grafts is pressuring current postoperative outcomes. DCD grafts in particular are associated with ischemic-type biliary lesions (ITBL) with subsequent impaired graft survival rates. METHODS Retrospective single-center study of all LT since the start of DCD program (2001-2015). CCI (at hospital discharge and after 6 months) was the result of all complications weighted by their Clavien-Dindo grade. A multiple logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with a complex postoperative course (CCI at 6 months {\textgreater}60). RESULTS In total, 441 cases were included: 115 DCD and 326 DBD grafts. Median in-hospital CCI was comparable for both groups (DCD 38.2; DBD 36.7; P = 0.429). Six-month postoperative median CCI was significantly higher for DCD grafts (53.4 vs 47.2; P = 0.041). Moreover, more DCD recipients underwent retransplantation for ITBL in this period (4{\%} vs 1{\%}; P = 0.031). Logistic regression identified recipient BMI (P = 0.046), recipient warm ischemia time (odds ratio, OR, 1.032; 95{\%} CI, 1.008-1.056; P = 0.008), and DCD graft (OR 3.913; 95{\%} CI 1.200-12.767; P = 0.024) as risk factors for a CCI {\textgreater}60. CONCLUSIONS This analysis shows a comparable complication rate during the index hospital stay for DCD and DBD LT, but the CCI increases significantly for DCD recipients in 6 months after transplantation. Reduction of biliary complications, especially ITBL, is needed to improve the outcomes for DCD grafts.},

Patients and methods Records of 137 patients (125 males {\&} 12 females, mean age- 54) who underwent salvage laryngectomy from 2004-2010 were reviewed. Glottis (63) was most common subsite followed by hypopharynx (51), supraglottis (21) and unknown epicenter (2). 39 patients had preoperative chemoradiotherapy and 98 underwent radiotherapy alone. Total laryngectomy with primary closure was done in 88 patients, onlay pectoralis major myofascial flap (PMMF) was done in 20 patients, reconstruction needed in 17(PMMC 14, free flap 3), and 12 patients needed gastric pull up. Results COMPLICATION 59(44 {\%}) patients developed pharyngocutaneous fistula(PCF). Out of the 59 complications, 37(62 {\%}) healed with conservative management. 4 patients how had undergone GPU died during post operative period. Patients who underwent CT/RT had more PCF (leak rate) (p=0.01). PMMF decreased the PCF (leak) significantly (p=0.03) as compared to primary closure. Patients with leak had poor swallowing outcome (p=0.001) SURVIVAL In the mean followup of 29 months, 33 (24 {\%})patients recurred (21 locoreginal, 10 distant, 2 second primary). 5 year disease free survival was 60 {\%} On univariate analysis age, perinodal extension and margin status (close or postive) significantly affected DFS. On multivariate analysis, only margin and PNE were significant.

abstract = {Child-Pugh classification has been a reference for more than 30 years for assessing the prognosis of cirrhosis. MELD score comes as the most serious challenger for replacing Child-Pugh score and overcoming its limitations. The principal advantages of MELD score are that (a) it is based on variables selected by statistical analysis rather than clinical judgement, (b) the variables are objective and unlikely to be influenced by external factors, (c) each variable is weighted according its proper influence on prognosis and (d) the score is continuous which helps scoring individuals more precisely among large populations. However, MELD score also has limitations including the need for computation, the absence of clearly defined cut-off values for categorizing cirrhotic patients and the absence of validation in some clinical situations. In addition, despite its theoretical advantages MELD score did not prove universally superior to Child-Pugh score in the setting of liver graft allocation and survival after TIPS. MELD score is superior to Child-Pugh for management and comparisons at a population level. Nonetheless, for the assessment of individuals at the bedside, it can be anticipated that Child-Pugh will resist as an almost intuitive score which can be combined easily with other clinical information. {\textcopyright} 2004 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

abstract = {The ability to estimate rather than measure the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in patients before and after liver transplantation would be helpful in estimating risk, dosing drugs, and assessing long-term toxicity of calcineurin inhibitors. Currently available equations for estimating the GFR have not been validated in either the pre- or post-liver transplant population. We have evaluated the performance of currently used formulas for the estimation of the GFR in this setting. Data were collected prospectively on patients who underwent liver transplantation between 1984 and 2001. GFR per 1.73 m2 was measured by I125 iothalamate in patients at the pretransplant evaluation and at 3 months, 1 year, and yearly posttransplant thereafter. GFR estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation, the Nankivell equation, and the equations from the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study (6, 5, and 4 variables) was compared with the measured GFR. Pretransplant GFR was available in 1,447 patients. The mean GFR was 90.7 2+ 40.5 mL/min. Values for r and r2 were highest for the MDRD Study 6-variable equation (0.70 and 0.49, respectively). Only 66{\%} of estimates were within 30{\%} of the measured GFR. At 3 months, 1 year, and 5 years posttransplant, the mean GFR was 59.5 ± 27.1 mL/min, 62.7 ± 27.8 mL/min, and 55.3 ± 26.1 mL/min, respectively. Values for r and r2 for the MDRD Study 6-variable equations at 1 and 5 years posttransplant were 0.74 (0.55) and 0.76 (0-58), respectively. At these time points, however, only 67{\%} and 64{\%} of the estimated GFR were within 30{\%} of the measured GFR. MDRD Study equations had greater precision than other equations, but the precision was lower than reported for MDRD estimation of GFR in other populations. Better methods for estimating the GFR are required for evaluation of renal function before and after liver transplantation.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors. Hepatology published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc., on behalf of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and resulting nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are highly prevalent in the United States, where they are a growing cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and increasingly an indicator for liver transplantation. A Markov model was used to forecast NAFLD disease progression. Incidence of NAFLD was based on historical and projected changes in adult prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Assumptions were derived from published literature where available and validated using national surveillance data for incidence of NAFLD-related HCC. Projected changes in NAFLD-related cirrhosis, advanced liver disease, and liver-related mortality were quantified through 2030. Prevalent NAFLD cases are forecasted to increase 21{\%}, from 83.1 million (2015) to 100.9 million (2030), while prevalent NASH cases will increase 63{\%} from 16.52 million to 27.00 million cases. Overall NAFLD prevalence among the adult population (aged ≥15 years) is projected at 33.5{\%} in 2030, and the median age of the NAFLD population will increase from 50 to 55 years during 2015-2030. In 2015, approximately 20{\%} of NAFLD cases were classified as NASH, increasing to 27{\%} by 2030, a reflection of both disease progression and an aging population. Incidence of decompensated cirrhosis will increase 168{\%} to 105,430 cases by 2030, while incidence of HCC will increase by 137{\%} to 12,240 cases. Liver deaths will increase 178{\%} to an estimated 78,300 deaths in 2030. During 2015-2030, there are projected to be nearly 800,000 excess liver deaths. Conclusion: With continued high rates of adult obesity and DM along with an aging population, NAFLD-related liver disease and mortality will increase in the United States. Strategies to slow the growth of NAFLD cases and therapeutic options are necessary to mitigate disease burden. (Hepatology 2018;67:123-133).},

In this study, we investigated waiting-list (WL) outcomes (n53272) and post–liver transplanta- tion (LT) survival in 2 consecutive periods of 5 years before and after the implementation of a MELD-based allocation policy. Data were obtained from the database of the national institute for organ allocation in Argentina. After the adoption of the MELD system, there were significant reductions in WL mortality [28.5{\%} versus 21.9{\%}, P{\textless}0.001, hazard ratio (HR)51.57, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI)51.37-1.81] and total dropout rates (38.6{\%} versus 29.1{\%}, P{\textless}0.001, HR51.31, 95{\%} CI51.16-1.48) despite significantly less LT accessibility (57.4{\%} versus 50.7{\%}, P{\textless}0.001, HR51.53, 95{\%} CI51.39-1.68). The annual number of deaths per 1000 patient-years at risk decreased from 273 in 2005 to 173 in 2010, and the number of LT procedures per 1000 patient-years at risk decreased from 564 to 422. MELD and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease– Sodium scores were excellent predictors of 3-month WL mortality with c statistics of 0.828 and 0.857, respectively (P{\textless}0.001). No difference was observed in 1-year posttransplant survival between the 2 periods (81.1{\%} versus 81.3{\%}). Although patients with a MELD score{\textgreater}30 had lower posttransplant survival, the global accuracy of the score for predicting outcomes was poor, as indicated by a c statistic of only 0.523. Patients with granted MELD exceptions (158 for hepatocellu- lar carcinoma and 52 for other reasons) had significantly higher access to LT (80.4{\%}) in comparison with nonexception patients with equivalent listing priority (MELD score518-25; 54.6{\%}, P{\textless}0.001, HR50.49, 95{\%} CI50.40-0.61). In conclu- sion, the adoption of the MELD model in Argentina has resulted in improved liver organ allocation without compromising posttransplant survival.},

abstract = {In recent years, acute-on-chronic liver failure has been recognized as a specific clinical form of liver failure associated with cirrhosis. The syndrome refers to an acute deterioration of liver function and subsequently of other end organs over a period of weeks following a precipitating event in a patient with previously well- or reasonably well-compensated cirrhosis. These precipitating events include either an indirect (e.g., variceal hemorrhage, sepsis) or a direct (e.g., drug-induced) hepatotoxic factor. The short-term mortality for this condition is more than 50{\%}. At present, considerable efforts are ongoing to better characterize the syndrome, to gain further insight into its pathophysiology and to optimize therapy. This article aims to highlight the current concepts of these various aspects. {\textcopyright} 2011 Expert Reviews Ltd.},

Primary TL is indicated in advanced disease that is not amenable to partial laryngectomy, concurrent chemoradiation, or radiotherapy alone. Specifically, tumors that have penetrated through cartilage, invasion into the extralaryngeal soft tissue of the neck, and extensive involvement of the base of tongue are suitable for this procedure. Non-neoplastic indications for primary TL include laryngeal dysfunction with life-threatening aspiration or chondro-radionecrosis of the larynx. Also, pulmonary status and medical comorbidities and cognitive function may define the treatment options for a given patient.
Salvage TL is indicated for chemoradiation, radiation, or partial laryngeal surgical failures. Salvage laryngectomy was required in 16{\%} of patients treated with concurrent chemoradiation and 31{\%} of patients treated with radiotherapy alone [8]. Salvage TL can be technically more difficult and carries a higher postoperative complication rate.},

Here, we present an OCT handheld probe dedicated to imaging the unique geometry involved in pediatric laryngoscopy. A vertical cavity surface emitting laser-based wavelength- swept OCT system operating at 60 frames per second was coupled to the probe to acquire three-dimensional (3-D) volumes in vivo. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed probe and system, we imaged pediatric vocal fold lesions of patients going under direct laryngoscopy. Through this in vivo study, we extracted OCT features characterizing each pediatric vocal fold lesion, which shows a great potential for noninvasive laryn- geal lesion discrimination. We believe OCT vocal fold examination in 3-D will result in improved knowledge of the pediatric anatomy and could aid in managing pediatric laryngeal diseases.},

All articles published in Annals of Otology, Rhinology and Laryngology, Archives of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery, Laryngoscope,and Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery in 2008 were reviewed and compared with prior data from 1978, 1988, and 1998. Subjects and Methods. Each published article's authorship panel was examined for the number of authors and each author's sex, degree, and the subspecialty area of publica- tion. Year-to-year comparisons were conducted for the rates and characteristics of female authorship. Results. A totalof544,629,713,and 785articlesfrom 1978, 1988, 1998, and 2008, respectively, were analyzed. From 1998 to 2008, the overall percentage of female authors increased from 14.5{\%} to 22.5{\%} (P $\backslash$ .001). Similarly, the percentage of articles with a female first author increased from 12.9{\%} to 21.3{\%} (P $\backslash$ .001). Whereas previously pediatric otolaryngology had the highest female first author percentage (range, 6.9{\%}- 19.4{\%}), in 2008 all other subspecialties demonstrated sig- nificant increases in female first author percentages: otol- ogy (18.6{\%}), general (22.3{\%}), head and neck (22.2{\%}), plastics (18.9{\%}), and pediatrics (19.4{\%}) (P = .885). A sig- nificant number of female first authors continue to be nonphysicians (19.2{\%} in 2008, P$\backslash$.001). Conclusions. Female authorship has shown significant and steady increases in the otolaryngology literature, particularly in the past decade. Increased rates of publication from female otolaryngologists within most subspecialties have resulted in similar rates of publication across the subspecialties.},

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of lipotoxicity, we used retroviral promoter trap mutagenesis to isolate a cell line that is resistant to lipotoxic and oxidative stress. We show that loss of three box C/D small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) encoded in the ribosomal protein L13a (rpL13a) locus is sufficient to confer resistance to lipotoxic and oxidative stress in vitro and prevents the propagation of oxidative stress in vivo. Our results provide evidence for a previously unappreciated, non-canonical role for box C/D snoRNAs as regulators of metabolic stress response pathways in mammalian cells. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In the GRADE approach, randomized trials start as high-quality evidence and observational studies as low-quality evidence, but both can be rated down if most of the relevant evidence comes from studies that suffer from a high risk of bias. Well-established limitations of randomized trials include failure to conceal allocation, failure to blind, loss to follow-up, and failure to appropriately consider the intention-to-treat principle. More recently recognized limitations include stopping early for apparent benefit and selective reporting of outcomes according to the results. Key limitations of observational studies include use of inappropriate controls and failure to adequately adjust for prognostic imbalance. Risk of bias may vary across outcomes (e.g., loss to follow-up may be far less for all-cause mortality than for quality of life), a consideration that many systematic reviews ignore. In deciding whether to rate down for risk of bias - whether for randomized trials or observational studies - authors should not take an approach that averages across studies. Rather, for any individual outcome, when there are some studies with a high risk, and some with a low risk of bias, they should consider including only the studies with a lower risk of bias. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Various treatment options exist for this condition, with the type I thyroplasty being one of the more commonly performed surgical procedures for vocal rehabilitation. The Voice-Related Quality of Life (V-RQOL) Measure is a validated outcomes instrument for voice disorders. This study measured the V-RQOL of patients with unilateral vocal fold paralysis who had undergone a type I thyroplasty and compared these scores to those of patients with untreated and uncompensated unilateral vocal fold paralysis and to normals. Treated patients had significantly higher domain and overall V-RQOL scores than untreated patients, but also scored lower than normals. These differences were true across gender and age. Patients who were more distant from surgery had lower V-RQOL scores than those who had more recently been treated. It is concluded that type I thyroplasty leads to a significantly higher V-RQOL for patients with unilateral vocal fold paralysis. This study also demonstrates further the utility of patient-oriented measures of treatment outcome.},

Material and methods A total of 40 patients with Tis-T3 laryngeal cancer treated with curative intent by radiotherapy were included in this prospective longitudinal descriptive study. Patients were followed pre-radiotherapy, one month, six months and 12 months post-radiotherapy, where voice recordings and patient-reported outcome instruments (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire Core30, Head and Neck35, Swedish Self-Evaluation of Communication Experiences after Laryngeal Cancer) were completed at each appointment. Perceptual analysis, using the Grade-Roughness-Breathiness-Asthenia-Strain scale and vocal fry parameters, and acoustic measures including harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR), jitter, shimmer and mean spoken fundamental frequency (MSFF) were produced from voice recordings. Results All patients presented with dysphonic voices pre-radiotherapy, where 95{\%} demonstrated some degree of vocal roughness. This variable improved significantly immediately post-radiotherapy, however, then deteriorated again between six and 12 months. Vocal fry also increased significantly at 12 months. Acoustic measures were abnormal pre- and post-treatment with no significant change noted except for MSFF, which lowered significantly by 12 months. Health-related quality of life (HRQL) deteriorated post-radiotherapy but returned to pretreatment levels by 12 months. Conclusion By 12 months, most perceptual, acoustic, patient-reported voice and HRQL outcomes for laryngeal cancer patients treated by radiotherapy had showed no significant improvements compared to pretreatment function. Further studies are required to investigate potential benefits of voice rehabilitation following radiotherapy.},

abstract = {It is critical to balance waitlist mortality against posttransplant mortality. Our objective was to devise a scoring system that predicts recipient survival at 3 months following liver transplantation to complement MELD-predicted waitlist mortality. Univariate and multivariate analysis on 21 673 liver transplant recipients identified independent recipient and donor risk factors for posttransplant mortality. A retrospective analysis conducted on 30 321 waitlisted candidates reevaluated the predictive ability of the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. We identified 13 recipient factors, 4 donor factors and 2 operative factors (warm and cold ischemia) as significant predictors of recipient mortality following liver transplantation at 3 months. The Survival Outcomes Following Liver Transplant (SOFT) Score utilized 18 risk factors (excluding warm ischemia) to successfully predict 3-month recipient survival following liver transplantation. This analysis represents a study of waitlisted candidates and transplant recipients of liver allografts after the MELD score was implemented. Unlike MELD, the SOFT score can accurately predict 3-month survival following liver transplantation. The most significant risk factors were previous transplantation and life support pretransplant. The SOFT score can help clinicians determine in real time which candidates should be transplanted with which allografts. Combined with MELD, SOFT can better quantify survival benefit for individual transplant procedures. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

These models quantify the impact of measurable and modifiable risk factors on the development of coronary heart disease and can be used to generate estimates of risk of coronary heart disease over a predetermined period, for example the next 10 years. We developed a system, which we call a points system, for making these complex statistical models useful to practitioners. The system is easy to use, it does not require a calculator or computer and it simplifies the estimation of risk based on complex statistical models. This system represents an effort to make available a tool for clinicians to aid in their decision-making process regarding treatment and to assist them in motivating patients toward healthy behaviours. The system is also readily available to patients who can easily estimate their own coronary heart disease risk and monitor this risk over time.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids and antiviral agents are widely used to treat the early stages of idiopathic facial paralysis (i.e., Bell's palsy), but their effectiveness is uncertain. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, factorial trial involving patients with Bell's palsy who were recruited within 72 hours after the onset of symptoms. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 10 days of treatment with prednisolone, acyclovir, both agents, or placebo. The primary outcome was recovery of facial function, as rated on the House-Brackmann scale. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, appearance, and pain. RESULTS: Final outcomes were assessed for 496 of 551 patients who underwent randomization. At 3 months, the proportions of patients who had recovered facial function were 83.0{\%} in the prednisolone group as compared with 63.6{\%} among patients who did not receive prednisolone (P{\textless}0.001) and 71.2{\%} in the acyclovir group as compared with 75.7{\%} among patients who did not receive acyclovir (adjusted P=0.50). After 9 months, these proportions were 94.4{\%} for prednisolone and 81.6{\%} for no prednisolone (P{\textless}0.001) and 85.4{\%} for acyclovir and 90.8{\%} for no acyclovir (adjusted P=0.10). For patients treated with both drugs, the proportions were 79.7{\%} at 3 months (P{\textless}0.001) and 92.7{\%} at 9 months (P{\textless}0.001). There were no clinically significant differences between the treatment groups in secondary outcomes. There were no serious adverse events in any group. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with Bell's palsy, early treatment with prednisolone significantly improves the chances of complete recovery at 3 and 9 months. There is no evidence of a benefit of acyclovir given alone or an additional benefit of acyclovir in combination with prednisolone.

A silicone rubber implant was inserted through a window in the thyroid ala and placed between the inner and outer perichondrium to externally mediallze the abducted vocal fold. Measures of fundamental frequency (vocal pitch), pitch range, maximum phonation time, s/z ratio, pitCh perturbation (vocal jitter), and amplitude perturbation (vocal shimmer) were made 1 to 2 weeks preoper-atively and 1 month postoperatively. Postoperative voice quality was characterized by an Improved pitch range, phonation time. s/z ratio, and pitch and amplitude per-turbatlon. No change was noted in fundamental frequency. Changes in postoperative voice quality were unrelated to the subjects' preoperative age, sex, etiology, and duration of the paralysis. (OTOLARYNGOL HEAD NECK SURG 1992;107:558.) Surgical correction of unilateral vocal fold paralysis was first reported in 1911 by Brunings, 1 who described intracordal injection of paraffin for the glottal insuffi-ciency. Several years later, Payr' described a laryngeal framework technique in which he used an anteriorly based flap of thyroid cartilage to medialize the abducted vocal fold. Neither technique proved highly successful and thus did not gain widespread acceptance. The in-tracordal injection resulted in a foreign body reaction, and the laryngeal framework procedure produced in-sufficient medialization because of difficulty estimating the degree of displacement. Surgical correction for unilateral vocal fold paralysis was essentially neglected during the period from 1920 through 1950, until research in autologous and allo-plastic tissue implantation led to a re-emergence of both approaches as feasible surgical options.

abstract = {Modeling sources of listener variability in voice quality assessment is the first step in developing reliable, valid protocols for measuring quality, and provides insight into the reasons that listeners disagree in their quality assessments. This study examined the adequacy of one such model by quantifying the contributions of four factors to interrater variability: instability of listeners' internal standards for different qualities, difficulties isolating individual attributes in voice patterns, scale resolution, and the magnitude of the attribute being measured. One hundred twenty listeners in six experiments assessed vocal quality in tasks that differed in scale resolution, in the presence/absence of comparison stimuli, and in the extent to which the comparison stimuli (if present) matched the target voices. These factors accounted for 84.2{\%} of the variance in the likelihood that listeners would agree exactly in their assessments. Providing listeners with comparison stimuli that matched the target voices doubled the likelihood that they would agree exactly. Listeners also agreed significantly better when assessing quality on continuous versus six-point scales. These results indicate that interrater variability is an issue of task design, not of listener unreliability.},

Morphologically, though the transplanted site appeared to have good mucosal healing, the fate of the donor mucosa is not known. The objective of this study was to determine the survival of the mucosa of donor trachea. Study Design and Setting: University hospital-based, prospective study. Methods: Thirty samples from six sets of specimens, each set consisting of five samples of the tracheal mucosa, were studied. Of five samples in each set, 2 were taken from donors, one from a recipient, and another two from the transplanted sites, eight months postoperatively. The samples in each set of specimens were genetically matched by the process of DNA fingerprinting. Histological studies were done on the mucosa of donor and transplanted sites. Results: The study demonstrated incompatibility between samples from recipient and transplanted site, and incompatibility between preoperative donor and recipient samples in all sets of specimens. Conclusion: The mucosa of donor trachea did not survive at the transplanted site. The apparently normal postoperative mucosal lining actually represents migration of the recipient mucosa. Significance: The fate of transplanted donor tracheal mucosa is elucidated, and may substantially explain the mechanism of rejection resistance. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation.},

Animals were killed after observation for periods of two to six wk postoperatively. Marked infection, ulceration and granulation tissue formation were observed in most of the stented animals, with the nonstented animals showing the most complete and uncomplicated healing. In this experimental model, acute laryngeal 'fractures' were adequately stabilized by suturing and a stable cartilaginous framework supported the healing intralaryngeal soft tissue. Avoidance of stenting in this animal series appears to decrease infection, ulceration and granulation tissue formation resulting in improved healing.},

Eighty-nine patients affected by T2 and T3 glottic tumors were treated by TLS from 2005 to 2010 at an academic institution by Type V cordectomies using an "en bloc" or, more frequently, a "piece-meal" technique depending on a number of variables. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to evaluate 5-year overall, disease-specific survivals, local control with laser, and organ preservation rates. Univariate analysis of the impact of different variables was performed. At least 1 year after surgery, we examined: subjective voice evaluation by voice handicap index (VHI), perceptive analysis by GRBAS scale, objective measurements with multidimensional voice program (MDVP), swallowing assessment with the M.D. Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI), videonasal endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (VEES), and videofluoroscopy (VFS). Fifty-nine patients were pT2 and 30 pT3. The 5-year overall, disease-specific survivals, local control with laser, and organ preservation rates were 92.4, 98.7, 68.5, and 82.1 {\%}, respectively. VHI mean score was 20 (mild dysphonia). Mild and moderate dysphonias were detected by GRBAS in 82 and 18{\%} of patients, respectively. Mean values of Jitter, Shimmer, and noise-to-harmonic ratio by MDVP resulted 7.87{\%}, 24.8{\%}, and 0.37, respectively. Mean value of MDADI was 95.75. Only 2{\%} of patients at VEES and 4{\%} at VFS showed tracheal aspiration. Our results highlight that T2 and selected T3 glottic tumors treated by TLS have favorable oncologic and functional outcomes.},

abstract = {In a quasi-experimental design, we investigated the quality of life (QOL) in actual liver donors (n = 43) and potential liver donors (n = 33) before and 3 months after liver transplantation. This is the first study in this field combining a prospective design with an adequate control group. Potential donors served as a control group because they also had a relative in need of a liver transplant and were as emotionally involved with the recipient as actual donors, but they were not subjected to the donor operation. Groups did not differ in age, gender, marital status, donor-recipient relationship, urgency of transplantation, or recipient group (adult versus child). Actual donors showed decreased physical QOL, whereas potential donors were not affected. However, for both groups, a decrease in anxiety was found. Furthermore, actual donors showed a better mental QOL postoperatively than potential donors. The recipients of these 2 groups did not differ with respect to postoperative complications. Furthermore, the groups did not report a different caregiver burden, but actual donors showed higher self-esteem. Because of the surgery, the worsening of physical symptoms in actual donors was expected. It is remarkable, however, that although actual donors still showed a limited physical QOL 3 months after the operation, in both groups, a similar reduction in anxiety could be observed, and actual donors even demonstrated a better mental QOL postoperatively than potential donors. The latter might be due to a psychological benefit that actual donors derived from the fact that they were able to help the recipients.},

abstract = {PURPOSETo compare the safety and efficacy of corticorelin acetate (CrA) and placebo in patients with malignant brain tumors requiring chronic administration of dexamethasone (DEX) to control the signs and symptoms of peritumoral brain edema (PBE). PATIENTS AND METHODSProspective, randomized, double-blind study of 200 patients with PBE on a stable dose of DEX. Initially, DEX dose was decreased by 50{\%} over a 2-week period and then held at this level for 3 weeks. The primary end point was the proportion of patients who responded to treatment-patients who achieved a ≥ 50{\%} DEX reduction from baseline and achieved stable or improved neurologic examination score and Karnofsky performance score at week 2, and then continued to respond at week 5.ResultsOne hundred patients received subcutaneous injections of 1 mg twice per day of CrA and 100 patients received placebo for the duration of the study period. Although results did not attain statistical significance (at the P {\textless} .05 level), a clinically important difference in the proportion of responders between the CrA group (57.0{\%}) and the placebo group (46.0{\%}; P = .12) was observed. In addition, the maximum percent reduction in DEX dose achieved during the double-blind 12-week study was significantly greater in the CrA group (62.7{\%}) than in placebo group (51.4{\%}; P {\textless} .001). Patients receiving CrA demonstrated an improvement in myopathy and were less likely to develop signs of Cushing syndrome. CONCLUSIONCrA enables a reduction in steroid requirement for patients with PBE and is associated with a reduction in the incidence and severity of common steroid adverse effects, including myopathy.},

If anatomical changes during inspiration and phonation are compared by three-dimensional computed tomography (3D CT), it is possible to observe vertical movement of the paralyzed arytenoid. Our aim was to use 3D CT to examine the characteristics of 3D arytenoid movement in unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP). This is a prospective study. A total of 61 patients (18 females and 43 males) with UVFP who had undergone 3D CT imaging between April 2005 and January 2007 were included. Cricoid and arytenoid cartilage was imaged by 3D CT. We detected the movements of the paralyzed side when comparing inspiration and phonation. The degree of cranial displacement of the paralyzed arytenoids was classified into three grades (I for mild to III for severe). The mean flow rate (MFR) was calculated for each grade. By comparing the MFR of each grade with the normal control group, we determined whether cases would worsen according to grade. Passive gliding movement of the paralyzed arytenoids was found in 90.7{\%} of cases. In all cases, the paralyzed arytenoids were displaced cranially compared to the unaffected side. MFR worsened significantly as the grade became more severe. We believe that the passive gliding movements observed when comparing inspiration and phonation are characteristic of paralysis. Even in mild cases, the paralyzed arytenoids are passively displaced cranially during phonation, and the degree of this displacement is one indicator that can be used to evaluate the severity of UVFP.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley {\&} Sons LtdBackground {\&} Aims: With restricted numbers of available organs, futility in liver transplantation has to be avoided. The concept of dynamic changes in MELD score (DeltaMELD) has previously been shown to be a simple tool to identify patients with the greatest risk of death after transplantation. Aim was to validate this concept with the Eurotransplant (ET) database. Methods: A retrospective registry analysis was performed on all patients listed for liver transplantation within ET between 2006 and 2011. Patients {\textless}18 years of age, acute liver failure, malignancy and patients listed for retransplantation were excluded. Influence of MELD at listing (MELDon), MELD at transplantation (MELDoff), DeltaMELD, age, sex, underlying disease and time on the waiting list on overall survival after liver transplantation were evaluated. Results: A total of 16 821 patients were listed for liver transplantation, 8096 met the inclusion criteria. Age, MELD on and DeltaMELD showed significant influence on survival on the waiting list. Age and DeltaMELD showed influence on survival after liver transplantation, with DeltaMELD{\textgreater}10 showing a 1.6-fold increased risk of death. Conclusion: The concept of DeltaMELD was validated in a large, prospective data set. It provides a simple tool to identify patients with increased risk of death after liver transplantation and might help improve long-term results.},

abstract = {Background and Aims: Over the last decade, liver transplantation of sicker, older non-hepatitis C cirrhotics with multiple co-morbidities has increased in the United States. We sought to identify an easily applicable set of recipient factors among HCV negative adult transplant recipients associated with significant morbidity and mortality within five years after liver transplantation. Methods: We collected national (n = 31,829, 2002–2015) and center-specific data. Coefficients of relevant recipient factors were converted to weighted points and scaled from 0–5. Recipient factors associated with graft failure included: ventilator support (five patients; hazard ratio [HR] 1.59; 95{\%} CI 1.48–1.72); recipient age {\textgreater}60 years (three patients; HR 1.29; 95{\%} CI 1.23–1.36); hemodialysis (three patients; HR 1.26; 95{\%} CI 1.16–1.37); diabetes (two patients; HR 1.20; 95{\%} CI 1.14–1.27); or serum creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dl without hemodialysis (two patients; HR 1.15; 95{\%} CI 1.09–1.22). Results: Graft survival within five years based on points (any combination) was 77.2{\%} (0–4), 69.1{\%} (5–8) and 57.9{\%} ({\textgreater}8). In recipients with {\textgreater}8 points, graft survival was 42{\%} (model for end-stage liver disease [MELD] score {\textless}25) and 50{\%} (MELD score 25–35) in recipients receiving grafts from donors with a donor risk index {\textgreater}1.7. In center-specific data within the first year, subjects with ≥5 points (vs. 0–4) had longer hospitalization (11 vs. 8 days, p {\textless}0.01), higher admissions for rehabilitation (12.3{\%} vs. 2.7{\%}, p {\textless}0.01), and higher incidence of cardiac disease (14.2{\%} vs. 5.3{\%}, p {\textless}0.01) and stage 3 chronic kidney disease (78.6{\%} vs. 39.5{\%}, p = 0.03) within five years. Conclusion: The impact of co-morbidities in an MELD-based organ allocation system need to be reassessed. The proposed clinical tool may be helpful for center-specific assessment of risk of graft failure in non-HCV patients and for discussion regarding relevant morbidity in selected subsets. Lay summary: Over the last decade, liver transplantation of sicker, older patient with multiple co-morbidities has increased. In this study, we show that a set of recipient factors (recipient age {\textgreater}60 years, ventilator status, diabetes, hemodialysis and creatinine {\textgreater}1.5 mg/dl) can help identify patients that may not do well after transplant. Transplanting sicker organs in patients with certain combinations of these characteristics leads to lower survival.},

abstract = {Pharyngocutaneous fistulae occur in 15{\%}-25{\%} of patients after total laryngectomy. Factors that may predispose to fistulae formation include prior radiation, surgical technique, tumor size and location, and patient nutritional status. In addition, many surgeons believe that the timing of oral feeding after surgery contributes to fistula development. Thus, they advocate delaying feeding postoperatively, especially in high-risk patients. The traditional guideline has been to wait until the seventh postoperative day. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the timing of postoperative oral feeding and the development of pharyngocytaneous fistulae after total laryngectomy with primary closure in patients with squamous cell carcinoma. A questionnaire was sent to 210 members of the American Society for Head and neck Surgery to determine practice patterns toward feeding after laryngectomy. We also reviewed the records of 137 patients who underwent total laryngectomy at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center and the Denver VA Medical Center from January 1975 through December 1987. Of the surgeons polled, 84.5{\%} waited at least 7 days after surgery to begin oral feeding. However, in reviewing 94 patients eligible for study, we found no difference in the rate of fistula formation between patients fed on or before the fifth postoperative day and those fed on or after the sixth postoperative day. In fact, most fistulae were evident before the patient started oral feeding. Pyriform sinus tumors were predisposed to fistulae but prior radiotherapy and neck dissection seemed to have no effect. Earlier oral feeding after total laryngectomy may improve patient comfort and shorten hospital stay without increasing the incidence of complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Twenty-one total laryngectomies were performed from August 2010 to April 2012, using TA-60 linear stapler for pharyngeal closure. Data collected included age, sex, staging, surgical margins and postoperative course (including complications and swallowing). Patients comprised twenty men and one woman. The mean age was 64 years. Two patients underwent preoperative radiotherapy. Four patients recurred after radiotherapy. Fifteen patients were untreated. Negative surgical margins were achieved in all patients. One patient developed slight pharyngocutaneous fistula. Patients resumed oral intake at 7 days. The mean hospital stay was 10 days. Using a linear stapler to close laryngopharyngeal cavity in total laryngectomy is simple, reliable and practical, avoids pollution of surgical area, saves operation time and decreases the incidence of pharyngocutaneous fistula.

The main reason for this is the formidable operation to which the patient is subjected and because of this, referral of cases tends to be too late. Increasing confidence in the operation should result in earlier surgery. The low incidence of uncontrollable rejection is an encouraging finding which should, in the future, make the results of grafting for nonmalignant parenchymatous liver disease better than those currently obtained with kidney grafts from cadaver donors. The surgery requires a large team of strongly motivated doctors, nurses and technicians, who must have continuing experience with technically successful orthotopic liver grafts in experimental animals.},

abstract = {Pharyngocutaneous fistula is a common and troublesome postoperative complication after total laryngectomy. The objective of this report was to determine the incidence, predisposing factors, and outcome of postlaryngectomy pharyngocutaneous fistula in patients operated on in our department and to describe the management of the complication.The medical records of 146 consecutive patients who underwent laryngeal surgery for squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx between 1990 and 2005 were assessed. All patients had similar preoperative/postoperative care. We studied a number of factors that could influence fistula formation such as age, gender, smoking, systemic disease, preoperative radiotherapy, previous tracheotomy, site of tumor, surgical procedure, positive surgical margins, type of closure (T vs. vertical), concurrent neck dissection, suture material, clinical stage, histologic grade, and experience of surgeon (consultant vs. resident). A pharyngocutaneous fistula was observed in 13{\%} (19/146) of the patients within a mean time of 9.6 days from surgery. Spontaneous closure with local wound care was noted in 17 (89{\%}) patients whereas a surgical closure was necessary in two. One patient required surgical closure by direct suture of the pharyngeal mucosa. Pectoralis major myocutaneous flap was used in another one. Our findings showed that fistula formation was significantly more common in patients who received previous radiotherapy or who had positive surgical resection margins or had a systemic disease. The mean healing time was 26 days. We concluded that pharyngocutaneous fistula remains a troublesome complication of the early postoperative period after total laryngectomy. There are many conflicting reports in the literature concerning the predisposing factors, but our data showed that the presence of systemic diseases, previous radiotherapy, and positive surgical margins can all be important predisposing factors, or at least underlying causes. Our experience confirmed that most fistulas can be successfully managed with conservative treatment.},

One of the pitfalls of the MELD score is the interlaboratory variability in all three components of the score (INR, bilirubin, creatinine).

abstract = {Background/Aims The utility of the model for end stage liver disease (MELD) score in non-transplant patients, particularly in those with less severe chronic liver disease remains uncertain. We studied and compared the predictive abilities of the MELD score and the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score for intermediate (1-year) and long-term (5-year) mortality. Methods One thousand six hundred and eleven patients with chronic liver disease were studied. Observed and predicted survival curves were plotted to evaluate the predictive ability of the MELD score for survival. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was used to compare the MELD and CTP score. A multivariable model was constructed to examine predictors of mortality. Results The MELD score was a good predictor of 1-year mortality in chronic liver disease (c-statistics for all subgroups ≥0.75) and of 3- and 6-month mortality in alcoholic hepatitis (c-statistic ≥0.83). The CTP score had similar predictive abilities as the MELD. Hepatic encephalopathy was a strong independent predictor of death (Hazard ratio - 2.8, P{\textless}0.0001). Conclusions The MELD score is a valid prognostic score for intermediate term mortality in a heterogeneous population with chronic liver disease although the CTP score is equivalent in predicting survival. Inclusion of hepatic encephalopathy adds additional prognostic value to the MELD score. {\textcopyright} 2004 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published by Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In recent years, acoustic perturbation measurement has gained clinical and research popularity due to the ease of availability of commercial acoustic analysing software packages in the market. However, because the measurement itself depends critically on the accuracy of frequency tracking from the voice signal, researchers argue that perturbation measures are not suitable for analysing dysphonic voice samples, which are aperiodic in nature. This study compares the fundamental frequency, relative amplitude perturbation, shimmer percent and noise-to-harmonic ratio between a group of dysphonic and non-dysphonic subjects. One hundred and twelve dysphonic subjects (93 females and 19 males) and 41 non-dysphonic subjects (35 females and 6 males) participated in the study. All the 153 voice samples were categorized into type I (periodic or nearly periodic), type II (signals with subharmonic frequencies that approach the fundamental frequency) and type III (aperiodic) signals. Only the type I (periodic and nearly periodic) voice signals were acoustically analysed for perturbation measures. Results revealed that the dysphonic female group presented significantly lower fundamental frequency, significantly higher relative amplitude perturbation and shimmer percent values than the non-dysphonic female group. However, none of these three perturbation measures were able to differentiate between male dysphonic and male non-dysphonic subjects. The noise-to-harmonic ratio failed to differentiate between the dysphonic and non-dysphonic voices for both gender groups. These results question the sensitivity of acoustic perturbation measures in detecting dysphonia and suggest that contemporary acoustic perturbation measures are not suitable for analysing dysphonic voice signals, which are even nearly periodic.},

However, the confrontation with the results obtained by surgical resection has never been done on an intention-to-treat basis. Between 1989 and 1997, 164 out of 1,265 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were evaluated for surgery. Seventy-seven (48 men, mean 61 years of age, 74 Child-Pugh class A, size 33 ± 18 mm) were resected (first line option) and 87 (65 men, mean 55 years of age, 50 Child- Pugh class B/C, size 24 ± 14 mm) were selected for transplantation. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year 'intention-to-treat' survival was 85{\%}, 62{\%}, and 51{\%} for resection and 84{\%}, 69{\%}, and 69{\%} for transplantation (8 drop-outs on waiting list). Bilirubin and clinically relevant portal hypertension were independent survival predictors after resection. Thereby, the 5-year survival of the best candidates (absence of clinically relevant portal hypertension, n = 35) was 74{\%}, whereas it was 25{\%} for the worst candidates (portal hypertension and bilirubin ≥ 1 mg/dL, n = 27) (P {\textless} .00001). The variable 'drop-out on waiting list' was the sole survival predictor after transplantation. The 2-year survival rate of patients evaluated for transplantation was 84{\%} in the 1989 to 1995 period (mean waiting time, 62 days; no drop-outs) and 54{\%} during 1996 to 1997 (mean waiting time, 162 days; 8 drop-outs) (P {\textless} .003). This outcome was significantly lower than that of the best candidates for resection (P = .002). In conclusion, a proper selection of candidates for resection promotes better results than transplantation, in which the results are significantly hampered by the growing incidence of drop-outs because of the increasing waiting time.},

For patients with other risk factors, standard exceptions (SEs) and nonstandard exceptions (NSEs) have been developed. We investigated whether this system of matched MELD scores achieves similar outcomes on the liver transplant waiting list for various diagnostic groups in Eurotransplant (ET) countries with MELD-based individual allocation (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany). A retrospective analysis of the ET wait-list outflow from December 2006 until December 2015 was conducted to investigate the relation of the unified MELD-based allocation to the risk of a negative wait-list outcome (death on the waiting list or delisting as too sick) as opposed to a positive wait-list outcome (transplantation or delisting as recovered). A total of 16,926 patients left the waiting list with a positive (11,580) or negative (5346) outcome; 3548 patients had a SE, and 330 had a NSE. A negative outcome was more common among patients without a SE or NSE (34.3{\%}) than among patients with a SE (22.6{\%}) or NSE (18.6{\%}; P {\textless} 0.001). Analysis by model-based recursive partitioning detected 5 risk groups with different relations of matched MELD to a negative outcome. In Germany, we found the following: (1) no SE or NSE, SE for biliary sepsis (BS); (2) SE for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS), or portopulmonary hypertension (PPH); and (3) SE for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) or polycystic liver disease (PcLD). In Belgium and the Netherlands, we found the following: (4) SE or NSE, or SE for HPS or PPH; and (5) SE for BS, HCC, PcLD, or PSC. In conclusion, SEs and NSEs do not even out risks across different diagnostic groups. Patients with SEs or NSEs appear advantaged toward patients with cirrhosis without SEs or NSEs.

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Treatment options for early laryngeal cancer are well established with good local control and 5-year survival. The commonest treatments are radiotherapy or transoral laser microsurgery (TLM). There are advantages and disadvantages of the different modalities, but debate continues regarding the voice outcomes posttreatment. This review will focus on early glottic carcinoma and voice outcomes following the different treatments. RECENT FINDINGS: TLM and radiotherapy are both likely to affect voice quality, but the extent of voice change depends on different factors. These factors can be divided into patient, tumour and treatment factors. Recent meta-analyses data show similar voice outcomes for either modality in the treatment of early glottic carcinoma. However, larger tumours and those involving the anterior commissure are associated with worse voice outcomes. SUMMARY: There are various considerations for the patient and clinician before deciding on the preferred treatment for early glottic carcinoma. Although both TLM and radiotherapy will affect voice outcomes, the recent meta-analyses show similar voice outcomes for either modality in the treatment of early glottic carcinoma. There are numerous variables in the published studies hindering direct comparisons. These include heterogeneous patient groups, different treatment standardization and methods of voice analysis},

abstract = {The contribution of turbulent noise was modeled in symmetric vocal folds. A two-mass model was used to simulate irregular vocal fold vibrations. The threshold values of system parameters to produce irregular vibrations were decreased as a result of turbulent airflow. Periodic vibrations were then driven into the regions of irregular vibrations. Using nonlinear dynamics including Poincar{\'{e}} map and Lyapunov exponents, irregular vibrations were demonstrated as chaos. For the deterministic vocal-fold model with noise free and steady airflow, a fine period-doubling bifurcation cascade was shown in a bifurcation diagram. However, turbulent noise added to the vocal-fold model would induce chaotic vibrations, broaden the regions of irregular vocal fold vibrations, and inhibit the fine period-doubling bifurcations in the bifurcation diagrams. The perturbations from neurological and biomechanical effects were simulated as a random variation of the vocal fold stiffness. Turbulent noise as an external random source, as well as random stiffness perturbation as an internal random source, played important roles in the presence of irregular vocal fold vibrations.},

abstract = {Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are a large class of small noncoding RNAs present in all eukaryotes sequenced thus far. As a family, they have been well characterized as playing a central role in ribosome biogenesis, guiding either the sequence-specific chemical modification of pre-rRNA (ribosomal RNA) or its processing. However, in higher eukaryotes, numerous orphan snoRNAs were described over a decade ago, with no known target or ascribed function, suggesting the possibility of alternative cellular functionality. In recent years, thanks in great part to advances in sequencing methodologies, we have seen many examples of the diversity that exists in the snoRNA family on multiple levels. In this review, we discuss the identification of novel snoRNA members, of unexpected binding partners, as well as the clarification and extension of the snoRNA target space and the characterization of diverse new noncanonical functions, painting a new and extended picture of the snoRNA landscape. Under the deluge of novel features and functions that have recently come to light, snoRNAs emerge as a central, dynamic, and highly versatile group of small regulatory RNAs.

abstract = {The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) recently implemented a 6-month delay before granting exception points to liver transplantation candidates with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to address disparity in transplantation access between HCC and non-HCC patients. An HCC-specific scoring scheme, the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease equivalent (MELDEQ), has also been developed. We compared projected dropout and transplant probabilities and posttransplant survival for HCC and non-HCC patients under the 6-month delay and the MELDEQ using UNOS data from October 1, 2009, to June 30, 2014, and multistate modeling. Overall (combined HCC and non-HCC) wait-list dropout was similar under both schemes and slightly improved (though not statistically significant) compared to actual data. Projected HCC wait-list dropout was similar between the MELDEQ and 6-month delay at 6 months but thereafter started to differ, with the 6-month delay eventually favoring HCC patients (3-year dropout 10.0{\%} [9.0{\%}-11.0{\%}] for HCC versus 14.1{\%} [13.6{\%}-14.6{\%}]) for non-HCC) and the MELDEQ favoring non-HCC patients (3-year dropout 16.0{\%} [13.2{\%}-18.8{\%}] for HCC versus 12.3{\%} [11.9{\%}-12.7{\%}] for non-HCC). Projected transplant probabilities for HCC patients were substantially lower under the MELDEQ compared to the 6-month delay (26.6{\%} versus 83.8{\%} by 3 years, respectively). Projected HCC posttransplant survival under the 6-month delay was similar to actual, but slightly worse under the MELDEQ (2-year survival 82.9{\%} [81.7{\%}-84.2{\%}] versus actual of 85.5{\%} [84.3{\%}-86.7{\%}]). In conclusion, although the 6-month delay improves equity in transplant and dropout between HCC and non-HCC candidates, disparity between the 2 groups may still exist after 6 months of wait-list time. Projections under the MELDEQ, however, appear to disadvantage HCC patients. Therefore, modification to the exception point progression or refinement of an HCC prioritization score may be warranted.

abstract = {MELD (model for end-stage liver disease) exception awards affect the liver allocation process. Award rates of specific nonhepatocellular carcinoma exceptions, termed symptom-based exceptions (SBE), differ across UNOS regions. We aimed to characterize the regional variability in SBE awards and examine predictive factors for receiving a SBE in the MELD era. The OPTN liver transplant and waiting list dataset was analyzed for waiting list registrants during the MELD allocation on February 27, 2002, until November 22, 2006. Competing risks proportional hazards regression analysis was used to examine predictors for receiving a SBE in 39 169 registrants. The hazard ratios for receiving a SBE differed significantly across regions when adjusted for multiple variables including age, gender, ethnicity, physiologic MELD score, blood group, functional status, etiology of liver disease, insurer and education level. Utilization of SBE is highly significantly variable across UNOS regions, and does not correlate with organ availability as estimated by the regional mean physiologic MELD score at transplantation. Patients with Medicaid as their primary payer have a lower likelihood of receiving a SBE award, while patients with cryptogenic/NASH cirrhosis or cholestatic liver disease have a higher likelihood of receiving a SBE. Reasons for these regional and demographic disparities deserve further investigation. {\textcopyright} Copyright 2011 The American Society of Transplantation.},

abstract = {Cancer of the larynx is a frequently occurring head and neck cancer in The Netherlands. The main risk factors are smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. The aim of our study was to evaluate the progress against laryngeal cancer by studying trends in incidence, mortality and survival in The Netherlands. All patients in The Netherlands Cancer Registry diagnosed with invasive primary squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx during the period 1989-2010 were included for analysis. Time trends in incidence, mortality, treatment and survival were described for the total group and stratified by sex and subsite: glottis, supraglottis and subglottis. The most frequently affected subsite for men was the glottis (69{\%}) and for women the supraglottis (55{\%}). Glottic cancer was diagnosed at lower stages than supraglottic cancer. Incidence and mortality rates decreased for males with -2.5 and -2.8{\%} per year, respectively, but remained stable for women, except for an increasing mortality rate in older women (EAPC: +2.5{\%}). Five-year relative survival rates were stable for glottic (85{\%}) and supraglottic (50{\%}) cancer, whereas patients with high-staged cancers more often received radiotherapy. Multivariable analysis showed lower relative excess risks of dying for women, younger patients ({\textless}75 years), glottic cancer, lower stage cancer and those undergoing surgery. Changes in incidence and mortality rates are in line with changing smoking habits in The Netherlands. Declining incidence with stable survival rates gives rise to hope and worry at the same time.},

abstract = {Numerous donor and recipient risk factors interact to influence the probability of survival after liver transplantation. We developed a statistic, D-MELD, the product of donor age and preoperative MELD, calculated from laboratory values. Using the UNOS STAR national transplant data base, we analyzed survival for first liver transplant recipients with chronic liver failure from deceased after brain death donors. Preoperative D-MELD score effectively stratified posttransplant survival. Using a cutoff D-MELD score of 1600, we defined a subgroup of donor-recipient matches with significantly poorer short- and long-term outcomes as measured by survival and length of stay (LOS). Avoidance of D-MELD scores above 1600 improved results for subgroups of high-risk patients with donor age ≥60 and those with preoperative MELD ≥30. D-MELD ≥1600 accurately predicted worse outcome in recipients with and without hepatitis C. There is significant regional variation in average D-MELD scores at transplant, however, regions with larger numbers of high D-MELD matches do not have higher survival rates. D-MELD is a simple, highly predictive tool for estimating outcomes after liver transplantation. This statistic could assist surgeons and their patients in making organ acceptance decisions. Applying D-MELD to liver allocation could eliminate many donor/recipient matches likely to have inferior outcome. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Authors.},

Ten patients (20{\%}) demonstrated a sinus tract originating from the pharyngeal suture line. A clinical salivary fistula developed in all four patients with a sinus tract 2 cm or longer, but in only one of six patients with a tract shorter than 2 cm. Other factors predictive of salivary fistula included tumor stage, previous radiation therapy, and the presence of concurrent postoperative complications. A single fistula developed in the 58 patients not studied with barium. Information provided by postlaryngectomy barium swallow appeared to predict, but not prevent salivary fistula formation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Under the current liver-transplantation policy, donor organs are offered to patients with the highest risk of death. METHODS Using data derived from all adult candidates for primary liver transplantation who were registered with the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network in 2005 and 2006, we developed and validated a multivariable survival model to predict mortality at 90 days after registration. The predictor variable was the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score with and without the addition of the serum sodium concentration. The MELD score (on a scale of 6 to 40, with higher values indicating more severe disease) is calculated on the basis of the serum bilirubin and creatinine concentrations and the international normalized ratio for the prothrombin time. RESULTS In 2005, there were 6769 registrants, including 1781 who underwent liver transplantation and 422 who died within 90 days after registration on the waiting list. Both the MELD score and the serum sodium concentration were significantly associated with mortality (hazard ratio for death, 1.21 per MELD point and 1.05 per 1-unit decrease in the serum sodium concentration for values between 125 and 140 mmol per liter; P{\textless}0.001 for both variables). Furthermore, a significant interaction was found between the MELD score and the serum sodium concentration, indicating that the effect of the serum sodium concentration was greater in patients with a low MELD score. When applied to the data from 2006, when 477 patients died within 3 months after registration on the waiting list, the combination of the MELD score and the serum sodium concentration was considerably higher than the MELD score alone in 32 patients who died (7{\%}). Thus, assignment of priority according to the MELD score combined with the serum sodium concentration might have resulted in transplantation and prevented death. CONCLUSIONS This population-wide study shows that the MELD score and the serum sodium concentration are important predictors of survival among candidates for liver transplantation.},

abstract = {Often, in follow-up studies, patients experience intermediate events, such as reinterventions or adverse events, which directly affect the shapes of their longitudinal profiles. Our work is motivated by two studies in which such intermediate events have been recorded during follow-up. In both studies, we are interested in the change of the longitudinal evolutions after the occurrence of the intermediate event and in utilizing this information to improve the accuracy of dynamic prediction of their risk. To achieve so, we propose a flexible joint modeling framework for longitudinal and time-to-event data, which includes features of the intermediate event as time-varying covariates in both the longitudinal and survival submodels. We consider a set of joint models that postulate different effects of the intermediate event in the longitudinal profile and the risk of the clinical endpoint, with different formulations for the association structure while allowing its functional form to change after the occurrence of the intermediate event. Based on these models, we derive dynamic predictions of conditional survival probabilities which are adaptive to different scenarios with respect to the occurrence of the intermediate event. We evaluate the predictive accuracy of these predictions with a simulation study using the time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the expected prediction error adjusted to our setting. The results suggest that accounting for the changes in the longitudinal profiles and the instantaneous risk for the clinical endpoint is important, and improves the accuracy of the dynamic predictions.},

abstract = {Context—In February 2002, the allocation system for liver transplantation became based on the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. Before MELD, black patients were more likely to die or become too sick to undergo liver transplantation compared with white patients. Little information exists regarding sex and access to liver transplantation. Objective—To determine the association between race, sex, and liver transplantation following introduction of the MELD system. Design, Setting, and Patients—A retrospective cohort of black and white patients (≥ 18 years) registered on the United Network for Organ Sharing liver transplantation waiting list between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2000 (pre-MELD cohort, n=21 895) and between February 28, 2002, and March 31, 2006 (post-MELD cohort, n=23 793). Main Outcome Measures—Association between race, sex, and receipt of a liver transplant. Separate multivariable analyses evaluated cohorts within each period to identify predictors of time to death and the odds of dying or receiving liver transplantation within 3 years of listing. Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were analyzed separately. Results—Black patients were younger (mean [SD], 49.2 [10.7] vs 52.4 [9.2] years; sicker (MELD score at listing: median [interquartile range], 16 [12–22] vs 14 [11–19]; P P {\textless} .001) and {\textless} .001) than white patients on the waiting list for both periods. In the pre-MELD cohort, black patients were more likely to die or become too sick for liver transplantation than white patients (27.0{\%} vs 21.7{\%}) within 3 years of registering on the waiting list (odds ratio [OR], 1.51; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 1.15–1.98; P = .003). In the post-MELD cohort, black race was no longer associated with increased likelihood of death or becoming too sick for liver transplantation (26.5{\%} vs 22.0{\%}, respectively; OR, 0.96; 95{\%} CI, 0.74–1.26; P = .76). Black patients were also less likely to receive a liver transplant than white patients within 3 years of registering on the waiting list pre-MELD (61.6{\%} vs 66.9{\%}; OR, 0.75; 95{\%} CI, 0.59–0.97; P = .03), whereas post-MELD, race was no longer significantly associated with receipt of a liver transplant (47.5{\%} vs 45.5{\%}, respectively; OR, 1.04;95{\%}CI, 0.84–1.28; P = .75).Women were more likely than men to die or become too sick for liver transplantation post-MELD (23.7{\%} vs 21.4{\%}; OR, 1.30; 95{\%}CI, 1.08–1.47; P = . 003) vs pre-MELD (22.4{\%} vs 21.9{\%}; OR, 1.08; 95{\%} CI, 0.91–1.26; P = .37). Similarly, women were less likely than men to receive a liver transplant within 3 years both pre-MELD (64.8{\%} vs 67.6{\%}; OR, 0.80; 95{\%} CI, 0.70–0.92; P = .002) and post-MELD (39.9{\%} vs 48.7{\%}; OR, 0.70; 95{\%} CI, 0.62–0.79; P {\textless} .001).

abstract = {BACKGROUND China officially launched a pilot program of organ donation after cardiac death to overcome the shortage of available organs since 2011. Voluntary organ donation by deceased citizens became the only source of transplant organs beginning January 1, 2015. To investigate public opinions on organ donation by deceased donors, and discuss the effect of these opinions on the willingness and attitude of the public regarding voluntary organ donation. MATERIAL AND METHODS We designed a questionnaire. The survey was conducted from December 2014 to January 2015 in Changsha City, and 417 valid questionnaires were recovered. RESULTS A total of 162 respondents explicitly expressed a willingness to donate organs, and 269 believed that the organ donors' relatives should be compensated. A total of 255 respondents thought it acceptable to complete the donation-consent form when receiving a driver's license. Among the respondents, 65.3{\%} did not agree with the statement "My body is bestowed by my parents, and to donate my body parts would not display filial respect"; 88.9{\%} agreed that "It is necessary to consider the willingness of my family"; 74.4{\%} agreed that "Donated organs have not been fairly and appropriately used; the wealthy and celebrities have been favored"; and 61.4{\%} agreed that "Organ donation laws and regulations are not well developed, and organ donations will result in unnecessary difficulties." More than 80{\%} believed that organ donation and transplantation extend life. CONCLUSIONS Public opinions on organ donation after death are associated with various factors, including traditional values, religious beliefs, compensation mechanisms, donor registration, institutional credibility, and ideals.},

abstract = {In an effort to establish factors responsible for our post laryngectomy fistulae we reviewed 357 patients who underwent total laryngectomy between 1965 and 1990, for laryngeal carcinoma. Pharyngocutaneous fistulae occurred in 84 cases (23 per cent). There was no difference between the fistula group and the non-fistula group with regard to age, sex, general condition, or tumour differentiation. The only significant, positive association was with previous radical radiotherapy (10 fistulae out of 167 primary laryngectomies (4 per cent) versus 74 fistulae out of 190 salvage laryngectomies (39 per cent)). The median time to occurrence of a fistula was day seven in both groups. However, in the non-radiotherapy group the median duration of the fistula was 28 days; the majority healing spontaneously, with only one patient requiring surgical closure. There were no 'hospital' deaths. In the radiotherapy group the median duration of fistulae was 112 days with 30 patients requiring a total of 66 procedures to achieve closure of the fistula. There were six 'hospital' deaths in this group. We conclude that previous radical radiotherapy strongly predisposes towards the occurrence of a post-laryngectomy fistula. Fistulae in this group tend to be longer lasting and are more likely to require surgical repair.},

We investigated the voice outcomes of subligamentous cordectomy of progressive anterior-posterior extent of excision. STUDY DESIGN Physical phonatory modeling. METHODS The influence of vocal fold surgical defects and corresponding scar was experimentally investigated using a self-oscillating physical model of the vocal folds and compared with the baseline model without defects or scar. RESULTS Results showed that increasing anterior-posterior extent of resection increased phonation threshold pressure and flow rate and reduced excitation of high-order harmonics, resulting in a more breathy and rough voice production. However, it was found that voice production was improved with the placement of scar, which increased both excitation of high-order harmonics and the harmonic-to-noise ratio. CONCLUSIONS Although large anterior-posterior surgical resections resulted in progressive impact on vocal measures, a limited excision of the vocal fold cover surprisingly demonstrated minimal voice changes. Further investigations are required to define the acceptable extent of surgical resection that may result in optimal voice outcomes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Assessing the effect of donor hepatectomy time on outcome after transplantation. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA When blood supply in a deceased organ donor stops, ischemic injury starts. Livers are cooled to reduce cellular metabolism and minimize ischemic injury. This cooling is slow and livers are lukewarm during hepatectomy, potentially affecting outcome. METHODS We used the Eurotransplant Registry to investigate the relationship between donor hepatectomy time and post-transplant outcome in 12,974 recipients of deceased-donor livers (January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2013). Cox regression analyses for patient and graft survival (censored and uncensored for death with a functioning graft) were corrected for donor, preservation, and recipient variables. Donor hepatectomy time was defined as time between start of aortic cold flush and placement of the liver in the ice-bowl. RESULTS Median donor hepatectomy time was 41 minutes [interquartile range (IQR) 32 to 52]. Livers donated after circulatory death had longer hepatectomy times than those from brain-dead donors [50 minutes (35 to 68) vs 40 minutes (32 to 51), P {\textless} 0.001]. Donor hepatectomy time was independently associated with graft loss [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.03 for every 10-minute increase, 95{\%} confidence interval (95{\%} CI) 1.02-1.05; P {\textless} 0.001]. The magnitude of this effect was comparable to the effect of each hour of additional cold ischemia time (adjusted HR 1.04, 95{\%} CI 1.02-1.05; P {\textless} 0.001). Donor hepatectomy time had a similar effect on death-censored graft survival and patient survival. Livers donated after circulatory death and those with a higher donor risk index were more susceptible to the effect of donor hepatectomy time on death-censored graft survival. CONCLUSION Donor hepatectomy time impairs liver transplant outcome. Keeping this time short together with efficient cooling during hepatectomy might improve outcome.},

abstract = {The use of stapling devices to close hypopharyngeal defects was first published in 1969 but the technique does not seem to have gained much popularity among head and neck surgeons. Fifty-nine hypopharyngeal defects were closed using a linear stapler between January, 1984, and April, 1989, at the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery of the University Hospital of Zurich. Twenty closures were performed following resection of hypopharyngeal diverticula, 39 following wide field laryngectomy. A total of 10 salivary fistulae was observed: 2 after diverticulectomy (10{\%}), 3 after laryngectomy in nonirradiated patients (11{\%}), and 5 after laryngectomy in irradiated patients (45{\%}). These fistula rates are comparable with average rates quoted in the literature. Only after laryngectomy for radiation failure was the fistula rate unusually high. No other complications were seen that could have been attributed to this type of pharyngeal closure. Closure of a hypopharyngeal defect with a stapler is easier and faster than with traditional suture methods. Provided the patient has not been previously irradiated, staple closure of the hypopharynx appears to be as reliable as closure by standard techniques and can be safely recommended.},

abstract = {The usual method of estimating survival probabilities, namely the Kaplan-Meier method, is suboptimal in the analysis of deaths on the transplant waiting list. Death, transplantation, and withdrawal from list must all be considered. In this analysis, we applied the competing risk analysis method, which allows evaluating these end points individually and simultaneously, to compare the risk of waiting list death across era, blood types, liver disease diagnosis, and severity (Model for End-stage Liver Disease; MELD). Of 861 patients registered on the waiting list at Mayo Clinic Rochester between 1990 and 1999, 657 (76{\%}) patients underwent transplantation, 82 (10{\%}) died while waiting, 41 (5{\%}) withdrew from the list, and 81 (9{\%}) patients were still waiting as of February 2002. The risk of death at 3 years was 10{\%} by the competing risk analysis. During the study period, the median time to transplantation increased from 45 to 517 days. In univariate analyses, there was no significant difference in the risk of death by era of listing (P = .25) or blood type (P = .31), whereas the risk of death was significantly higher in patients with alcohol-induced liver disease and those with higher MELD score (P {\textless} .01). A multivariable analysis showed that after adjusting for MELD, blood type, and diagnosis, patients listed in the latter era had higher mortality. In conclusion, the competing risk analysis method is useful in estimating the risk of death among patients awaiting liver transplantation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2004, level I evidence was established for the postoperative adjuvant treatment of patients with selected high-risk locally advanced head and neck cancers, with the publication of the results of two trials conducted in Europe (European Organization Research and Treatment of Cancer; EORTC) and the United States (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group; RTOG). Adjuvant chemotherapy-enhanced radiation therapy (CERT) was shown to be more efficacious than postoperative radiotherapy for these tumors in terms of locoregional control and disease-free survival. However, additional studies were needed to identify precisely which patients were most suitable for such intense treatment. METHODS: Both studies compared the addition of concomitant relatively high doses of cisplatin (on days 1, 22, and 43) to radiotherapy vs radiotherapy alone given after surgery in patients with high-risk cancers of the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, or hypopharynx. A comparative analysis of the selection criteria, clinical and pathologic risk factors, and treatment outcomes was carried out using data pooled from these two trials. RESULTS: Extracapsular extension (ECE) and/or microscopically involved surgical margins were the only risk factors for which the impact of CERT was significant in both trials. There was also a trend in favor of CERT in the group of patients who had stage III-IV disease, perineural infiltration, vascular embolisms, and/or clinically enlarged level IV-V lymph nodes secondary to tumors arising in the oral cavity or oropharynx. Patients who had two or more histopathologically involved lymph nodes without ECE as their only risk factor did not seem to benefit from the addition of chemotherapy in this analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Subject to the usual caveats of retrospective subgroup analysis, our data suggest that in locally advanced head and neck cancer, microscopically involved resection margins and extracapsular spread of tumor from neck nodes are the most significant prognostic factors for poor outcome. The addition of concomitant cisplatin to postoperative radiotherapy improves outcome in patients with one or both of these risk factors who are medically fit to receive chemotherapy.},

abstract = {Several epidemiological studies have shown a positive association between adult height and cancer incidence. The only study conducted among women on mouth and pharynx cancer risk, however, reported an inverse association. This study aims to investigate the association between height and the risk of head and neck cancer (HNC) within a large international consortium of HNC. We analyzed pooled individual-level data from 24 case-control studies participating in the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology Consortium. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated separately for men and women for associations between height and HNC risk. Educational level, tobacco smoking, and alcohol consumption were included in all regression models. Stratified analyses by HNC subsites were performed. This project included 17,666 cases and 28,198 controls. We found an inverse association between height and HNC (adjusted OR per 10 cm height = 0.91; 95{\%} CI 5 0.86-0.95 for men; adjusted OR = 0.86; 95{\%} CI 5 0.79-0.93 for women). In men, the estimated OR did vary by educational level, smoking status, geographic area, and control source. No differences by subsites were detected. Adult height is inversely associated with HNC risk. As height can be considered a marker of childhood illness and low energy intake, the inverse association is consistent with prior studies showing that HNC occur more frequently among deprived individuals. Further studies designed to elucidate the mechanism of such association would be warranted.},

AA was performed by pulling the lateral cricoarytenoid muscle (LCA) (5 patients) or muscular process (7 patients) through the posterior fenestration in the contractile direction of the LCA without releasing the cricoarytenoid joint. The operation was performed under local anesthesia with sedation except in two patients who underwent general anesthesia using a laryngeal mask. The vocal cord medialization was confirmed endoscopically during the operation. For all patients, the MPT and mean airflow rate (MFR) were measured before and after the operation. The postoperative voices were analyzed using shimmer and jitter., RESULT: All patients achieved a MPT of over 12 seconds. The MFR, which ranged from 340 to 1902 mL/second before the operation, improved to less than 200 mL/second, except in one patient whose MFR was 210 mL/second. Shimmer and jitter improved significantly after the operation. Perceptual evaluation using the GRBAS (grade, roughness, breathiness, aesthenia, strain) scale also improved significantly., CONCLUSION: A fenestration-based approach simplified the combination of AA and type I thyroplasty because the two treatments could be performed in the same operating field and provided good voice improvement. Pulling the AA braid in the contractile direction of the LCA and endoscopic vocal cord observation during surgery may have contributed to the positive results.},

abstract = {Joint models for longitudinal and survival data have gained a lot of attention in recent years, with the development of myriad extensions to the basic model, including those which allow for multivariate longitudinal data, competing risks and recurrent events. Several software packages are now also available for their implementation. Although mathematically straightforward, the inclusion of multiple longitudinal outcomes in the joint model remains computationally difficult due to the large number of random effects required, which hampers the practical application of this extension. We present a novel approach that enables the fitting of such models with more realistic computational times. The idea behind the approach is to split the estimation of the joint model in two steps; estimating a multivariate mixed model for the longitudinal outcomes, and then using the output from this model to fit the survival submodel. So called two-stage approaches have previously been proposed, and shown to be biased. Our approach differs from the standard version, in that we additionally propose the application of a correction factor, adjusting the estimates obtained such that they more closely resemble those we would expect to find with the multivariate joint model. This correction is based on importance sampling ideas. Simulation studies show that this corrected-two-stage approach works satisfactorily, eliminating the bias while maintaining substantial improvement in computational time, even in more difficult settings.},

abstract = {Current imaging techniques provide only limited information pertaining to the extent of infiltration of laryngeal carcinomas into vocal fold tissue layers. Therefore, it is needed to seek the contribute to the body of knowledge surrounding examination and characterization in laryngeal carcinoma infiltration. Excised larynges were collected from 30 male laryngectomy patients with an average age of 43.5 years (ranging 36 to 55 years) and history of smoking (≥10 years) exhibiting T1, T2, or subglottal (normal vocal fold) carcinomas. Vocal folds were preserved via freezing or immersion in paraffin. The depth of the mucosa, submucosa, and muscular layers in both normal vocal folds and tumor tissues of afflicted vocal folds was measured. The average depths of the mucosa, submucosa, and muscular layers in normal vocal folds were 0.15 ± 0.06 mm, 2.30 ± 0.59 mm, and 2.87 ± 0.88 mm, respectively. Infiltration measurements of T1 tumors showed a depth of 1.62 ± 0.51 mm and 1.32 ± 0.49 mm in frozen sections and paraffin-embedded samples, respectively. Similarly, T2 tumors showed a depth of 2.87 ± 0.68 mm and 2.58 ± 0.67 mm in frozen sections and paraffin-embedded samples, respectively. T1 and T2 tumors occupied 24.8 ± 10 and 48.5 ± 15 percent of the normal vocal fold depth, respectively. This data provides a baseline for estimating infiltration of laryngeal carcinomas in vocal fold tissue layers, of particular interest to surgeons. This information may be used to assess typical depths of infiltration, thus allowing for more appropriate selection of surgical procedures based on individual patient assessment.},

abstract = {Objective: 1) Report the incidence of complications and feeding outcomes in salvage laryngectomy performed with free tissue transfer compared to primary closure. 2) Evaluate factors that may be associated with an increased rate of complications. Method: Retrospective case series from a single institution between 2007 to 2012. Thirty-two patients met the following inclusion criteria: patients undergoing salvage laryngectomy with primary wound closure (16 patients) and those patients undergoing salvage laryngectomy with wound closure augmentation by microvascular free tissue transfer (16 patients). Results: We performed a retrospective case series comparing complications in salvage laryngectomy closed primarily vs repair with free tissue transfer. Smoking status at surgery was similar between the 2 groups. In the primary closure group we report major fistula in 37.5{\%}, minor fistula in 19{\%}, dysphagia requiring dilatation in 25{\%}, and feeding tube dependence in 14{\%} of patients. In the free tissue transfer group we report major fistula formation in 12.5{\%}, dysphagia requiring dilatation in 12.5{\%}, and feeding tube dependence in 8{\%} of patients. Minor fistula did not occur in the free tissue transfer group. Conclusion: Multiple factors were compared and preliminary data suggests that free tissue transfer reduces major and minor fistula rates. Additionally, fewer patients required dilatation and fewer patients were feeding tube-dependent in the free tissue transfer group. Formal statistical analysis will be performed.},

The objective of the study is to evaluate the incidence of pharingocutaneous salivary fistulae after total laryngectomies comparing manual and mechanical sutures. The study is designed as non-randomized, prospective clinical study. Sixty patients with squamous cell carcinoma were submitted to total laryngectomies. In 30 cases, the linear stapler (75 mm) closure (surgical technique described in details) and in other 30 cases manual suture was used. The cases of mechanical suture were prospective and consecutive and the cases of manual suture were a review series of patients who underwent a manual suture of pharynx, in the same period of time. The statistical analysis between the two groups concluded that both were comparable. Fistulae incidence was 6.7{\%} (2/30) in the group with the mechanical suture and 36.7{\%} (11/30) in the group with manual suture closure, presenting a significant difference (p = 0.0047). The total laryngectomy with mechanical closure is an easy and fast learning technique, allowing watertight closure of the pharynx with a low risk of contamination of the surgical field. It is an assured method, even in previously irradiated patients, since we respect the limits of its indication regarding the extension of primary tumor that must be confirmed by previous suspension laryngectomy performed in the operating room.},

abstract = {External laryngeal trauma is a rare but potentially life-threatening situation in the acutely injured patient. Trauma mechanism and magnitude, maximum focus of the applied force, and patient related factors, such as age and ossification of the laryngeal cartilages influence the spectrum of observed injuries. Their correct diagnosis and prompt management are paramount in order to avoid patient death or long-term impairment of breathing, swallowing and speaking. The current review provides a comprehensive approach to the radiologic interpretation of imaging studies performed in patients with suspected laryngeal injury. It describes the key anatomic structures that are relevant in laryngeal trauma and discusses the clinical role of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the acute emergency situation. The added value of two-dimensional multiplanar reconstructions (2D MPR), three-dimensional volume rendering (3D VR) and virtual endoscopy (VE) for the non-invasive evaluation of laryngeal injuries and for treatment planning is discussed. The clinical presentation, biomechanics of injury, diagnostic pitfalls and pearls, common and uncommon findings are reviewed with emphasis of fracture patterns, involvement of laryngeal joints, intra- and extralaryngeal soft tissue injuries, and complications seen in the acute emergency situation. The radiologic appearance of common and less common long-term sequelae, as well as treatment options are equally addressed. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Kidney injury is frequently seen in patients with end-stage liver disease from cirrhosis and liver failure. Among selected patients, simultaneous liver kidney (SLK) transplantation provides improved post-transplant graft and patient outcomes compared to liver transplantation (LT) alone. We conducted the review of the existing literature on SLK transplant criteria and outcomes. Since the introduction of the model for end-stage disease (MELD) score in 2002, there has been an increased use of SLK transplantation. The criteria for SLK allocation are relatively homogeneous among patients with end-stage renal disease with cirrhosis and among patients with cirrhosis and chronic kidney disease. However, these are quite heterogeneous among patients with cirrhosis and acute kidney injury (AKI), mainly because of inability to accurately differentiate cause of AKI, especially hepatorenal syndrome versus intrarenal aetiology. Clearly, there is an unmet need of urine biomarkers of tubular injury and/or clinical models to accurately stratify AKI aetiology and to predict renal recovery after LT as basis to best utilize the scarce donor kidney pool. In this regard, it remains to be seen whether recently implemented policies by the organ procurement transplant network can fulfil the goal of saving donor kidneys and optimal allocation of SLK.},

abstract = {Liver transplantation has undergone a rapid evolution from a high-risk experimental procedure to a mainstream therapy for thousands of patients with a wide range of hepatic diseases. Its increasing success has been accompanied by progressive imbalance between organ donor supply and the patients who might benefit. Where demand outstrips supply in transplantation, a system of organ allocation is inevitably required to make the wisest use of the available, but scarce, organs. Early attempts to rationally allocate donor livers were particularly hampered by lack of available and suitable data, leading to imperfect solutions that created or exacerbated inequities in the system. The advent and maturation of evidence-based predictors of waiting list mortality risk led to more objective criteria for liver allocation, aided by the increasing availability of data on large numbers of patients. Until now, the vast majority of allocation systems for liver transplantation have relied on estimation of waiting list mortality. Evidence-based allocation systems that incorporate measures of post-transplant outcomes are conceptually attractive and these transplant benefit-based allocation systems have been developed, modeled, and subjected to computer simulation. Future implementations of benefit-based liver allocation await continued refinement and additional debate in the transplant community.},

Various techniques for tracheal replacement have been used with varying degrees of success. In this study we used cryopreserved, irradiated tracheal homografts, the use of which in human beings has not been reported previously. In a sterile setup, the tracheas were harvested from donor cadavers within 24 hours of death. The grafts were initially kept at 57 degrees C for 20 minutes; they were then placed in a -70 degrees C chamber for another 2 to 3 days or more and were irradiated to 25 kGy (2.5 million rad). Finally, the grafts were stored at -70 degrees C until usage. Seven patients underwent the surgery, but only 4 are presented here. In the remaining 3 patients, the follow-up time was too short to be evaluated. Four patients, 2 male and 2 female (aged 2-40 years, mean 16 years), with severe subglottic tracheal stenosis underwent segmental tracheal graft reconstruction. Immunosuppressant medications were not given to any patient. Follow-up ranged from 18 to 20 months. Three patients successfully underwent decannulation, and 1 patient had local infection and dislodgment of the intraluminal stent with subsequent restenosis. The postoperative tracheal lumen appeared to be near normal, with histologic evidence of normal respiratory epithelium at the grafted site. In conclusion, cryopreserved, irradiated tracheal homograft transplantation is a valuable alternative for subglottic tracheal reconstruction.},

abstract = {Background Tumour morphological criteria for determining the appropriateness of liver transplantation in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma poorly estimate post-transplantation mortality. The aim of this study was to develop and assess the utility of a continuous risk score in predicting overall survival following liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods We did a retrospective cohort analysis to develop a continuous multivariable risk score for assessment of overall survival following liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma. We used data from 420 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent liver transplantation between Jan 1, 2002, and Oct 31, 2014, at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF), Cleveland, OH, USA. The model we developed (Hazard Associated with Liver Transplantation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma; HALT-HCC) assessed the association of the following previously reported variables of interest with overall survival by use of multivariate Cox regression: MELD-sodium (MELD-Na), tumour burden score (TBS), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), year of transplantation, underlying cause of cirrhosis, neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio, history of locoregional therapy, and Milan criteria status. Once the risk equation was generated, validation and calibration of risk assessment was done with nationwide data for the same time period from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR; n=13 717). Findings The risk equation was generated as (1{\textperiodcentered}27 × TBS) + (1{\textperiodcentered}85 × lnAFP) + (0{\textperiodcentered}26 × MELD-Na) and the HALT-HCC score ranged from 2{\textperiodcentered}40 to 46{\textperiodcentered}42 in the CCF cohort. In the validation cohort, prognosis worsened with increasing HALT-HCC score (5-year overall survival of 78{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} [95{\%} CI 76{\textperiodcentered}9–80{\textperiodcentered}4] for quartile 1, 74{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} [72{\textperiodcentered}6–76{\textperiodcentered}2] for quartile 2, 71{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} [70{\textperiodcentered}1–73{\textperiodcentered}5] for quartile 3, and 61{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} [59{\textperiodcentered}6–63{\textperiodcentered}3] for quartile 4; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). Multivariate Cox modelling showed that HALT-HCC was significantly associated with overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 1{\textperiodcentered}06 per point, 95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}05–1{\textperiodcentered}07), even after adjustment for risk factors not related to hepatocellular carcinoma. Assessment of discrimination revealed a C-index of 0{\textperiodcentered}613 (95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}602–0{\textperiodcentered}623). Calibration coefficients for linear regressions of observed versus predicted mortality were 1{\textperiodcentered}001 (95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}998–1{\textperiodcentered}007) at 1 year and 0{\textperiodcentered}982 (0{\textperiodcentered}980–0{\textperiodcentered}987) at 2 years after transplantation. Patients within and outside the Milan criteria showed similar risk of death when stratified by HALT-HCC score. Among the 12 754 patients who met the Milan criteria, 2714 were shown to have poor prognosis after transplantation after stratification by HALT-HCC score with a cutoff of 17; conversely, among the 963 patients who did not meet the Milan criteria, 287 had demonstrably good prognosis. Interpretation The HALT-HCC score might enable clinicians to accurately assess post-transplantation survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma by use of individualised, preoperatively assessed characteristics. However, further studies are needed before adoption. Funding None.},

abstract = {Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in patients with cirrhosis. This disorder can be a result of substantial loss of extracellular fluid "hypotonic or hypovolemic hyponatremia" or develop in the context of an increase in extracellular fluid volume and in the absence of major sodium losses; this situation occurs in patients with advanced cirrhosis and is known as "dilutional or hypervolemic hyponatremia". In dilutional or hypervolemic hyponatremia, serum sodium concentration is reduced, plasma volume is increased (although the effective plasma volume is decreased due to marked arterial vasodilation in the splanchnic circulation) and extracellular fluid volume is increased, with ascites and edema in the absence of signs of dehydration. This is a result of the marked deterioration in renal excretion of solute-free water, leading to disproportionate water retention in relation to sodium retention. Hypotonic hyponatremia represents 10{\%} of all hyponatremias in patients with cirrhosis. Since hypervolemic hyponatremia is by far the most frequent form of this disorder, the present chapter will concentrate specifically on hypervolemic hyponatremia in cirrhosis.},

abstract = {Although the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease sodium (MELD Na) score is now used for liver transplant allocation in the United States, mortality prediction may be underestimated by the score. Using aggregated electronic health record data from 7834 adult patients with cirrhosis, we determined whether the cause of cirrhosis or cirrhosis complications was associated with an increased risk of death among patients with a MELD Na score ≤15 and whether patients with the greatest risk of death could benefit from liver transplantation (LT). Over median follow-up of 2.3 years, 3715 patients had a maximum MELD Na score ≤15. Overall, 3.4{\%} were waitlisted for LT. Severe hypoalbuminemia, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic hydrothorax conferred the greatest risk of death independent of MELD Na score with 1-year predicted mortality {\textgreater}14{\%}. Approximately 10{\%} possessed these risk factors. Of these high-risk patients, only 4{\%} were waitlisted for LT, despite no difference in nonliver comorbidities between waitlisted patients and those not listed. In addition, risk factors for death among waitlisted patients were the same as those for patients not waitlisted, although the effect of malnutrition was significantly greater for waitlisted patients (hazard ratio 8.65 [95{\%} CI 2.57–29.11] vs. 1.47 [95{\%} CI 1.08–1.98]). Using the MELD Na score for allocation may continue to limit access to LT.},

abstract = {Objectives/Hypothesis: Common endpoints in reporting the outcomes for early glottic cancer do not highlight the importance of organ preservation. We evaluated the treatment outcomes among patients with T1aN0 laryngeal cancer with laryngectomy-free disease-specific survival (LFS-DSS), which is defined as time to total laryngectomy or time to death from cancer cause, against all other endpoints. Study Design: Outcome research on an institutional database. Methods: A retrospective review covered all consecutive patients from 2003 to 2013. Patients with T1a laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were offered the options of either radiation treatment (RT) or transoral laser microsurgery (TLM). Tumor control, survival outcomes, standard definition laryngectomy-free survival (LFS), and LFS-DSS were calculated. Results: There were 105 patients, of whom 53 were treated with TLM and 52 were treated with RT. There were 11 recurrences within the TLM group, of which four were successfully salvaged with repeated TLM and two were salvaged with RT. Among the four recurrences within the RT group, all four patients had salvage total laryngectomies. The 5-year overall survival for patients treated with TLM versus RT was 86{\%} versus 85{\%} (P =.887), disease-free survival was 69{\%} versus 78{\%} (P =.151), LFS was 65{\%} versus 77{\%} (P =.198), LFS-DSS was 100{\%} versus 88{\%} (P =.030), and ultimate locoregional control was 100{\%} in both groups. Conclusions: Patients with T1aN0 glottic SCC treated with RT or TLM have similar survival outcomes. Patients with T1a tumor treated with TLM have better organ preservation compared to RT, when measured with LFS-DSS. Level of Evidence: 4. Laryngoscope, 127:1322-1327, 2017.

Successful techniques for closure include multiple layers of tissue, selected suture materials, the application of postoperative radiation therapy, and modified neck dissection. In addition, vocal rehabilitation has been traditionally associated with the formation of a pharyngoesophageal segment capable of producing sound after air insufflation. A three-year experience with 129 patients after they underwent a total laryngectomy and tracheoesophageal shunt showed that 16 patients (12{\%}) failed to achieve satisfactory speech after tracheoesophageal puncture because of pharyngoesophageal spasm. Response to percutaneous block of the pharyngeal plexus and subsequent myotomy of the cricopharyngeus and pharyngeal constrictor muscles was assessed in 14 patients. Increased pharyngoesophageal tone after total laryngectomy seems to be an important factor in the failure to acquire esophageal voice},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Score-based medical urgency criteria are used for necessity-oriented liver transplantation (OLT) but lead to an increasing number of complications in patients with reduced post-OLT survival. A prediction of outcome would improve preoperative patient selection and management. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One-hundred-and-thirty-three consecutive adult patients (63.9{\%} men, mean age 47.4+/-11.2 years) given transplants between May 2004 and November 2005 at the Hannover Medical School were analysed retrospectively using univariate and multivariate methods. RESULTS: Indications were: 27.1{\%} viral hepatitis, 19.6{\%} primary sclerosing cholangitis, 15.0{\%} alcoholic liver disease, 7.5{\%} metabolic liver disease, 6.8{\%} primary biliary cirrhosis. Overall, 12-month patient survival was 81.2{\%}. The mean MELD score at OLT was 14.5+/-5.3 and 12-month survival with MELD {\textgreater}16 (71.7{\%}) and {\textless}16 (86.2{\%}) differed significantly (p=0.041). Predictors of 12-month mortality included age (53.2+/-9.4 versus 46.1+/-11.2 years; p=0.004), lower cholinesterase (2.9+/-1.88 versus 3.7+/-2.02 kU/l; p=0.026) and serum creatinine (160.4+/-186.8 versus 77.7+/-31.6 micromol/l; p=0.007), with creatinine and cholinesterase as independent parameters. Based on these parameters, a model for predicting patient survival after liver transplantation was calculated and validated in a second independent cohort of 87 OLT patients. This score identified a high-risk group and a low-risk group (overall survival 47.4 versus 91.2{\%}; p{\textless}0.001) with a specificity of 87.3{\%} and a sensitivity of 68.75{\%}. CONCLUSION: Age, pre-OLT creatinine and cholinesterase are predictors of short-term post-OLT survival and may be helpful as a bedside score in pre-OLT clinical management, outcome prediction and decision-making.},

Improvement in the degree of aspiration, dict, and voice after laryngeal framework surgery have been seen in many patients. Rehabilitation of patients undergoing skull base surgery is also facilitated in respect to avoidance of trachcotomy, early swallowing, and a decrease in number of hospital days. Restoration of subglottic pressure is essential to achieve effective swallowing, and this is accomplished to varying degrees using medialization thyroplasty and arytenoid adduction. Laryngeal framework surgery is associated with low morbidity, and should remain an effective treatment option in those suffering from aspiration secondary to glottic insufficiency. {\textcopyright} 1998 W.B.

abstract = {Many prognostic systems have been devised to predict the outcome of liver transplantation (LT) candidates. Today, the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) is widely used for organ allocation, but it has shown some limitations. The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of MELD compared to 5 different score models. We evaluated the prognos- tic ability of MELD, modified Child-Turcotte-Pugh, MELD-sodium, United Kingdom MELD, updated MELD, and integrated MELD in 487 candidates with cirrhosis for LT at the Bologna Transplant Centre, Bologna, Italy, between 2003 and 2008. Cal- ibration analysis by Hosmer-Lemeshow test, calibration curves, and concordance c-statistics (area under the receiver oper- ating characteristic curve [AUC]) were calculated at 3, 6, and 12 months. Actual cumulative survival curves, taking into account the event of interest in the presence of competing risk, were obtained using the best cutoffs identified by AUC. For each score, the Hosmer-Lemeshow test revealed a good calibration. Integrated MELD showed calibration curves closer to the line of perfect predicting ability, followed by MELD-sodium at 3 months and modified Child-Turcotte-Pugh at 6 months. MELD-sodium AUCs at 3 and 6 months (0.798 and 0.765, respectively) and integrated MELD AUC at 6 months (0.792) were better than standard MELD (P {\textless} 0.05). Actual survival curves showed that these 2 scores were able to identify the patients with the highest drop-out risk. In conclusion, MELD-sodium and integrated MELD were the best prognostic models to predict drop-out rates among patients awaiting LT},

Patients' voices were recorded and analysed pre-treatment and 3, 6, 12 and 24 months post-treatment at their routine visit at the outpatient clinic. Average fundamental frequency (F0), percent jitter, percent shimmer and normalized noise energy (NNE) were determined. After 2 years, local control rate was 95{\%} in the radiotherapy group and 97{\%} in the laser surgery group. Larynx preservation rate was 95{\%} after radiotherapy and 100{\%} after laser surgery. Voice outcome recovers more quickly in patients treated with laser surgery in comparison to radiotherapy: 3 months after laser surgery there is no longer a difference with regard to normal voices except for the fundamental frequency, which remains higher pitched, even in the longer term. For patients treated with radiotherapy it takes longer for jitter, shimmer and NNE to become normal, where jitter remains significantly different from normal voices even after 2 years. According to these results, we believe that laser surgery is the first treatment of choice in the treatment of selected cases of T1a glottic carcinomas with good functional and oncological results.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Although the usefulness of antimicrobial prophylaxis for clean-contaminated surgery has been recognized, only a few randomized controlled studies on the duration of administration after hepatectomy have been performed. We investigated the duration of antimicrobial prophylaxis after hepatectomy.$\backslash$nMETHODS: The subjects were 180 patients who underwent hepatectomy without reconstruction of the biliary or intestinal tract between April 2003 and March 2006 at our department. The patients were randomly allocated to groups to be treated with flomoxef sodium as antimicrobial prophylaxis for 2 days (89 patients) or 5 days (91 patients), including the operation day. The presence or absence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and infections was investigated.$\backslash$nRESULTS: No significant differences were noted in patient background between the two groups. Infections occurred in seven and six patients in the 2 day and 5 day treatment groups (7.9{\%} and 6.6{\%}), respectively, showing no significant difference between the two groups. No significant difference was noted when the cases were divided into surgical site infections and remote infections. The positive rate of SIRS was significantly higher in the 2 day treatment group than in the 5 day treatment group on days 2 and 3 after surgery. The risk factors in patients who developed infections were blood loss, operation time and the complication of biliary fistula.$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Two day administration of flomoxef sodium may be sufficient for antimicrobial prophylaxis after hepatectomy. However, when SIRS is positive on post-operative day 2, and induction of liver failure is of concern, it may be safer to continue antimicrobial drug administration until SIRS is eliminated.},

abstract = {Objective: To systematically summarise the peer-reviewed literature relating to the aetiology, clinical presentation, investigation and treatment of geniculate neuralgia. Data sources: Articles published in English between 1932 and 2012, identified using Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases. Methods: The search terms 'geniculate neuralgia', 'nervus intermedius neuralgia', 'facial pain', 'otalgia' and 'neuralgia' were used to identify relevant papers. Results: Fewer than 150 reported cases were published in English between 1932 and 2012. The aetiology of the condition remains unknown, and clinical presentation varies. Non-neuralgic causes of otalgia should always be excluded by a thorough clinical examination, audiological assessment and radiological investigations before making a diagnosis of geniculate neuralgia. Conservative medical treatment is always the first-line therapy. Surgical treatment should be offered if medical treatment fails. The two commonest surgical options are transection of the nervus intermedius, and microvascular decompression of the nerve at the nerve root entry zone of the brainstem. However, extracranial intratemporal division of the cutaneous branches of the facial nerve may offer a safer and similarly effective treatment. Conclusion: The response to medical treatment for this condition varies between individuals. The long-term outcomes of surgery remain unknown because of limited data.},

abstract = {CONCLUSION: Pharyngo-cutaneous fistula is the most common complication after total laryngectomy (TL), with many factors linked to its emergence. However, it has rarely been associated with the type of pharyngeal suture. We conclude that the technique of surgical closure of the pharynx and care in the tightness of the suture seem to be fundamental factors for pharyngo-cutaneous fistula development. OBJECTIVE: The aim of present work was to determine whether the type of pharyngeal suture can be considered as a major risk factor for developing a pharyngo-cutaneous fistula following TL. METHODS: We carried out a series of 157 consecutive TLs. In the first 90 procedures, we performed a pharyngeal closure technique with T-shaped interrupted stitches reinforced with constrictors. In the other 67 cases, a doubled continuous suture technique with reinforcement with the cutaneous flap was developed. RESULTS: In all, 25.5{\%} of the cases sutured with the interrupted stitches developed a fistula while only 2.9{\%} of the patients that underwent continuous suture developed a fistula.},

abstract = {Purpose: Laryngeal fractures can occur in association with maxillofacial injuries and may lead to life-threatening airway obstruction. Because of a low incidence and a paucity of peer-reviewed information, there is no universally accepted treatment protocol and few clinicians have extensive experience with complex laryngo-tracheal trauma. The purpose of this retrospective analysis is to validate a treatment protocol for the management of laryngo-tracheal injuries occurring in severely injured patients by assessing the outcome of a consecutive series of patients who were treated by the same surgeons over a 12-year period. Patients and Methods: All patients with laryngeal fractures admitted to the trauma service at Legacy Emanuel Hospital and Health Center (LEHHC; Portland, OR) from 1992 to 2004 were managed by the same surgeons, using a standard protocol based on the stability of the airway, and were retrospectively identified using the LEHHC Trauma Registry. Using information from the Trauma Registry and individual physician chart notes, a database was created for the purpose of assessing outcome. The following data were collected: age, gender, mechanism of injury, number of associated injuries and the Injury Severity Score, Glasgow Coma Scale on admission, initial hematocrit, airway management techniques, length of hospital stay, LEHHC laryngeal injury classification, treatment modality, disposition, and any available follow-up. Descriptive statistics were used to describe demographics, treatment, and outcome. Outcome measures were defined as complications, airway patency, speech, and deglutition. Results: A total of 16,465 patients were identified from the Trauma Registry as having sustained head, neck, or facial injuries, of which 37 patients were diagnosed with laryngeal fractures. Complete patient records were available for 27 patients (mean age, 35.5 ?? 15.3 years; range, 8 to 80 years; 23 males, 4 females) who were classified according to the LEHHC laryngeal injury classification scheme. Most patients sustained injuries as the result of blunt trauma (n = 23; 85.1{\%}) and almost all of them had concomitant maxillofacial injuries (n = 26; 96.3{\%}). Twenty patients (74.1{\%}) required advanced airway intervention (tracheostomy, 14; endotracheal intubation, 5; emergent cricothyrotomy, 1), of which 13 patients underwent neck exploration. Eight of these patients required open reduction and internal fixation with titanium plates and screws, and 2 patients required the addition of an endolaryngeal stent. There was a general trend toward poorer outcome with increased LEHHC laryngeal injury classification. However, all patients were successfully decannulated, maintained patent airways, and ate a normal diet. Hoarseness was common in patients who underwent surgical exploration; however, long-term perioperative complications were rare and included infection requiring hardware removal (n = 1), unilateral vocal cord paralysis (n = 1), and subjective dysphagia. Conclusion: Fractures of the larynx are uncommon injuries that are frequently associated with maxillofacial trauma and are potentially associated with significant morbidity. Management of laryngo-tracheal injuries using a protocol based on airway status as described in this report results in airway patency, functional vocal quality, and normal deglutition for almost all patients. ?? 2006 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.},

abstract = {Purpose of review This article summarizes the landmark events that shaped current deceased donor liver allocation and distribution policy in the USA and to provide an update on recently approved and anticipated policy changes. Recent findings For liver transplant candidates with model for end-stage liver disease more than 11, the 'MELD-Na' equation incorporating serum sodium will be used for allocation starting January 2016. The 'delay and cap' policy for hepatocellular carcinoma delays the start of model for end-stage liver disease exception by 6 months and subsequently grants 28 points, with increases every 3 months thereafter up to a maximum score at 34 points. There is new guidance for exception petitions for neuroendocrine tumors, polycystic liver disease, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. New guidelines for selecting candidates for simultaneous liver-kidney transplant are being developed that may include a 'safety net' for liver-only recipients with posttransplant renal failure. In an effort to provide broader geographic sharing of livers than in the current distribution system, new larger geographic areas are being considered. Summary Recent policy changes were designed to reduce waitlist mortality, yet inclusion of outcomes measures in allocation and the use of larger geographic distribution units will likely guide future policy changes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: A wide range of well validated instruments is now available to assess voice quality and voice-related quality of life, but comparative studies of the responsiveness to change of these measures are lacking. The aim of this study was to assess the responsiveness to change of a range of different measures, following voice therapy and surgery. DESIGN: Longitudinal, cohort comparison study. SETTING: Two UK voice clinics. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and forty-four patients referred for treatment of benign voice disorders, 90 undergoing voice therapy and 54 undergoing laryngeal microsurgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Three measures of self-reported voice quality (the vocal performance questionnaire, the voice handicap index and the voice symptom scale), plus the short form 36 (SF 36) general health status measure and the hospital anxiety and depression score. Perceptual, observer-rated analysis of voice quality was performed using the grade-roughness-breathiness-asthenia-strain scale. We compared the effect sizes (i.e. responsiveness to change) of the principal subscales of all measures before and after voice therapy or phonosurgery. RESULTS: All three self-reported voice measures had large effect sizes following either voice therapy or surgery. Outcomes were similar in both treatment groups. The effect sizes for the observer-rated grade-roughness-breathiness-asthenia-strain scale scores were smaller, although still moderate. The roughness subscale in particular showed little change after therapy or surgery. Only small effects were observed in general health and mood measures. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the use of a voice-specific questionnaire is essential for assessing the effectiveness of voice interventions. All three self-reported measures tested were capable of detecting change, and scores were highly correlated. On the basis of this evaluation of different measures' sensitivities to change, there is no strong evidence to favour either the vocal performance questionnaire, the voice handicap index or the voice symptom scale.},

abstract = {Objective To evaluate short- and long-term vocal outcomes after medialization laryngoplasty (ML) using a silastic implant in patients with unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP). Design and Methods Prospective study of consecutive patients undergoing ML with silastic (MLS) diagnosed with UVFP from 2009 till 2012 and with at least 9 months follow-up. Pre- and post-treatment maximum phonation time (MPT) and voice handicap index (VHI) scores were compared to assess the impact of ML on these outcomes. Patients with high vagal lesions or lateralized vocal folds (very low MPT) were compared with the entire group and the literature. Results A total of 124 patients with UVFP underwent MLS. Forty-six patients were excluded as they either had a Gore-Tex implant (eight), short follow-up (20), or the primary case was a revision (18). Seventy-eight patients were included. Pretreatment mean VHI (total score) was 67 for the entire cohort. Postoperative VHI score was significantly lower both in short-term (3-8 weeks) follow-up, mean score 27 (paired t-test, P {\textless} 0.05) and in long-term follow-up (9-12 months), mean score 22 (P {\textless} 0.05). MPT was significantly improved from 8.3 pretreatment to 22.6 at short-term follow-up (P {\textless} 0.05) and to 24.2 long-term follow-up (P {\textless} 0.05). There were no significant differences between entire cohort and patients with a lateralized vocal fold or high vagal lesion. Comparable results were present when compared with the literature using similar metrics in patients undergoing an arytenoid procedure with/without medialization. Conclusion MLS alone is effective in managing UVFP in most patients.},

Dit artikel heeft de twijfel weggenomen of het nuttig is om onze data te onderzoeken: ze kunnen een zaak maken voor AA (kijken hoe groot MT 'controle groep' is) als onze uitkomst beter is, indien gelijke of mindere uitkomst krijgt dit artikel gelijk (lijkt het).
Wij hebben veel parameters, deze tonen (zoals bijvoorbeeld met de balken hier) en de daaruit gevonden nuances proberen te verklaren? Je kunt je deels beroepen op de literatuur, maar je weet dat er relatief weinig zulk complete data is, dus dat kun je ook weer aangeven.

Zij concluderen dat MLS alleen voor meeste pati{\"{e}}nten effectief genoeg is (ook bij hoog-vagale leasies en groot posterior gap). Wij doen echter veel AA, dus spreekt onze data wat dat betreft tegen?

Zie aantekeningen (laatste o.a.)
Interessant discussiepunt voor ons aangezien wij veel AA doen? Komt dit door de Gore-tex, of wellicht andere operatieve keuzes? Of gaan wij vanuit gewoonte sneller over op AA als we middels MT de stem niet adequaat vinden?

Moet de strekking van ons artikel een zaak tegen Gore-tex worden? Wat vinden de laryngologen ervan? Of ben ik nu te vrijpostig? En wat doen andere centra, gebruiken die ook Gore-tex?

Goed kijken naar VHI en MPT bij pati{\"{e}}nten die MT en MT+AA hebben gehad (kijken of we bij onze kleinere populatie het gelijk van deze auteurs kunnen vinden, en dus ons inderdaad achter de oren moeten gaan krabben; maar dan over het gebruik van Gore-tex?)},

Differences in swallowing function among the treatment groups were primarily the amounts and loci of oral and pharyngeal residues. The differing patterns of bolus residue may reflect the different mechanisms that were affected by the various procedures. Despite significant changes in some swallow measures, the patients did not complain of dysphagia. Oropharyngoesophageal swallow efficiency--a clinical measure that weighs the amount of bolus swallowed by total transit time--fell within normal limits for each patient group at each evaluation.

STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, observational study of 43 patients undergoing total laryngectomy. METHODS: Data collected included laryngeal defect closure type, tumour staging and demographic information. A barium swallow was performed on day 7-14 after surgery to assess for anterior pharyngeal pouch formation and fistula formation. RESULTS: The incidence of anterior pharyngeal pouch formation was 47 per cent. Patients who did not have an anterior pharyngeal pouch on swallow imaging assessment were less likely to develop a pharyngo-cutaneous fistula. There was no statistically significant association between laryngeal defect closure type and anterior pharyngeal pouch formation. CONCLUSION: The anterior pharyngeal pouch is a dynamic phenomenon best investigated with a fluoroscopic swallow imaging study. Its causes are multi-factorial. Absence of an anterior pharyngeal pouch appears to confer protection against pharyngo-cutaneous fistula formation, hastening commencement of adjuvant therapy and an oral diet.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND It is unclear whether liver transplantation confers an increase in health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) across all dimensions of health. This study aimed to estimate the effect of liver transplantation on HR-QoL. METHODS Pre- and post-transplantation patients attending an outpatient clinic were invited to complete the condition-specific 'Short form of liver disease QOL' questionnaire. Mixed-effect linear regression and propensity-score matching (PSM) on pre-transplantation characteristics were used to estimate the difference in overall HR-QoL associated with transplantation. RESULTS 454/609 (74.5{\%}) eligible patients were included in the analysis, 102 (22.5{\%}) pre-transplantation, and 352 (77.5{\%}) post-transplantation. Overall HR-QoL post-transplantation significantly increased in patients without hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ($\beta$=16.84, 95{\%} CI: 13.33 to 20.35, p{\textless}0.001), but not with HCC ($\beta$=1.25, 95{\%} CI: -5.09 to 7.60, p=0.704). Donation after circulatory death (DCD) organ recipients had a significantly lower HR-QoL ($\beta$=-4.61, 95{\%} CI: -8.95 to -0.24, p=0.043). Following PSM, transplantation was associated with a significant increase in overall HR-QoL (average treatment effect: 6.3,95{\%} CI: 2.1 to 10.9). CONCLUSION There is a significant improvement in HR-QoL attributable to transplantation in this cohort. Post-transplantation HR-QoL was affected by several factors, including HCC status and DCD transplantation, which has important implications for counselling prior to liver transplantation.

abstract = {Background: The assessment of calibration performance of risk prediction models based on regression or more flexible machine learning algorithms receives little attention. Main text: Herein, we argue that this needs to change immediately because poorly calibrated algorithms can be misleading and potentially harmful for clinical decision-making. We summarize how to avoid poor calibration at algorithm development and how to assess calibration at algorithm validation, emphasizing balance between model complexity and the available sample size. At external validation, calibration curves require sufficiently large samples. Algorithm updating should be considered for appropriate support of clinical practice. Conclusion: Efforts are required to avoid poor calibration when developing prediction models, to evaluate calibration when validating models, and to update models when indicated. The ultimate aim is to optimize the utility of predictive analytics for shared decision-making and patient counseling.},

Methods A retrospective chart review of 156 patients that underwent GML procedures between the years 1998-2002. Study population consisted of those patients who required revision surgery for any reason. Results Sixteen patients required 22 revision procedures. Indications for revision were divided into 2 groups, complications and glottal closure problems. Complications included extruded or displaced implants (n = 4). The most common glottal closure problem was undercorrection (n = 9). Others included anterior overcorrection (n = 1) and persistent posterior glottal gap (n = 2). Revision procedures included GML (n = 9), injection augmentation (n = 9), endoscopic implant removal (n = 2), and arytenoid adduction (n = 2). In patients with glottal closure problems, the GCI improved in all 10 and the voice rating scale improved in 9. Conclusion Reasons for revision of GML are variable, the most common being undercorrection. A variety of safe, effective revision techniques are available with a high success rate.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: Cirrhotic patients with acute decompensation frequently develop acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), which is associated with high mortality rates. Recently, a specific score for these patients has been developed using the CANONIC study database. The aims of this study were to develop and validate the CLIF-C AD score, a specific prognostic score for hospitalised cirrhotic patients with acute decompensation (AD), but without ACLF, and to compare this with the Child-Pugh, MELD, and MELD-Na scores. Methods: The derivation set included 1016 CANONIC study patients without ACLF. Proportional hazards models considering liver transplantation as a competing risk were used to identify score parameters. Estimated coefficients were used as relative weights to compute the CLIF-C ADs. External validation was performed in 225 cirrhotic AD patients. CLIF-C ADs was also tested for sequential use. Results: Age, serum sodium, white-cell count, creatinine and INR were selected as the best predictors of mortality. The C-index for prediction of mortality was better for CLIF-C ADs compared with Child-Pugh, MELD, and MELD-Nas at predicting 3- and 12-month mortality in the derivation, internal validation and the external dataset. CLIF-C ADs improved in its ability to predict 3-month mortality using data from days 2, 3-7, and 8-15 (C-index: 0.72, 0.75, and 0.77 respectively). Conclusions: The new CLIF-C ADs is more accurate than other liver scores in predicting prognosis in hospitalised cirrhotic patients without ACLF. CLIF-C ADs therefore may be used to identify a high-risk cohort for intensive management and a low-risk group that may be discharged early.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite more than 70 randomised trials, the effect of chemotherapy on non-metastatic head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma remains uncertain. We did three meta-analyses of the impact of survival on chemotherapy added to locoregional treatment. METHODS: We updated data on all patients in randomised trials between 1965 and 1993. We included patients with carcinoma of the oropharynx, oral cavity, larynx, or hypopharynx. FINDINGS: The main meta-analysis of 63 trials (10,741 patients) of locoregional treatment with or without chemotherapy yielded a pooled hazard ratio of death of 0.90 (95{\%} CI 0.85-0.94, p{\textless}0.0001), corresponding to an absolute survival benefit of 4{\%} at 2 and 5 years in favour of chemotherapy. There was no significant benefit associated with adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Chemotherapy given concomitantly to radiotherapy gave significant benefits, but heterogeneity of the results prohibits firm conclusions. Meta-analysis of six trials (861 patients) comparing neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus radiotherapy with concomitant or alternating radiochemotherapy yielded a hazard ratio of 0.91 (0.79-1.06) in favour of concomitant or alternating radiochemotherapy. Three larynx-preservation trials (602 patients) compared radical surgery plus radiotherapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus radiotherapy in responders or radical surgery and radiotherapy in non-responders. The hazard ratio of death in the chemotherapy arm as compared with the control arm was 1.19 (0.97-1.46). INTERPRETATION: Because the main meta-analysis showed only a small significant survival benefit in favour of chemotherapy, the routine use of chemotherapy is debatable. For larynx preservation, the non-significant negative effect of chemotherapy in the organ-preservation strategy indicates that this procedure must remain investigational.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of early oral feeding by comparing it with feeding through primary tracheoesophageal puncture after total laryngectomy with primary pharyngeal closure. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, controlled study. METHODS: Patients who underwent total laryngectomy with primary pharyngeal closure and who were candidates for primary voice restoration (an in whose cases primary tracheoesophageal puncture [TEP] was created) were included. After total laryngectomy, patients were randomly assigned to either the oral group (study group) or the TEP group (control group). Patients in the oral group were fed orally with a clear liquid diet on the first postoperative day, then advanced to a regular diet, whereas patients in the TEP group were fed through tracheoesophageal puncture and received nothing orally until the seventh postoperative day; then they were fed orally if fistula had not occurred. Standard criteria for discharge were used for all the patients. RESULTS: During a 3-year period, 67 patients were enrolled in the trial, and complete data were available for 65 patients (32 patients in the oral group, 33 patients in the TEP group). The two groups were similar for factors reported to influence the rate of pharyngocutaneous fistula. In three (9{\%}) patients in the TEP group, fistula occurred on the 5th, 7th, and 14th postoperative days, respectively. Two (6.2{\%}) fistulas occurred in the oral group on the sixth and eighth postoperative days, respectively. In patients without fistula, the mean length of hospital stay was 7.6 days (range, 4-19 d [SD = 3.1 d]) for the oral group and 8.2 days (range, 7-18 d [SD = 2.6 d) for the TEP group. There was no significant difference between two groups for either the incidence of fistula or the length of hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: Initiation of oral feeding on the first postoperative day in patients undergoing total laryngectomy with primary pharyngeal closure is a safe clinical practice. However, it does not shorten the length of hospital stay for these patients.},

abstract = {PURPOSE To report complications encountered by members of a collaborative group who performed radio-frequency (RF) ablation in patients with focal liver cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS Members of 41 Italian centers that were part of a collaborative group used a percutaneous internally cooled RF ablation technique and a standardized protocol for follow-up. They completed a questionnaire regarding number of deaths, presumed cause of death, and likelihood of its relationship to the RF procedure; number and types of major complications; and types of minor complications and side effects. Enrollment included 2,320 patients with 3,554 lesions (size, 3.1 cm +/- 1.1 [SD] in diameter): 1,610 had hepatocellular carcinoma with chronic liver disease; 693 had metastases, predominantly from colorectal cancer (n = 501); and 17 had cholangiocellular carcinoma. Number and characteristics of complications (ie, deaths and major and minor complications) attributed to the procedure were reported. Data were subsequently analyzed with analysis of variance to determine whether the major complication rate was related to tumor size, number of ablation sessions, or electrode type (single or cluster). RESULTS In total, 3,554 lesions were treated. Six deaths (0.3{\%}) were noted, including two caused by multiorgan failure following intestinal perforation; one case each of septic shock following Staphylococcus aureus-caused peritonitis, massive hemorrhage following tumor rupture, liver failure following stenosis of right bile duct; and one case of sudden death of unknown cause 3 days after the procedure. Fifty (2.2{\%}) patients had additional major complications. The most frequent of these were peritoneal hemorrhage, neoplastic seeding, intrahepatic abscesses, and intestinal perforation. An increased number of RF sessions were related to a higher rate of major complications (P {\textless}.01), whereas the number of complications was not significantly different when tumor size or electrode type were compared. Minor complications were observed in less than 5{\%} of patients. CONCLUSION Results of this study confirm that RF ablation is a relatively low-risk procedure for the treatment of focal liver tumors.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: An optimal allocation system for scarce resources should simultaneously ensure maximal utility, but also equity. The most frequent principles for allocation policies in liver transplantation are therefore criteria that rely on pre-transplant survival (sickest first policy), post-transplant survival (utility), or on their combination (benefit). However, large differences exist between centers and countries for ethical and legislative reasons. The aim of this study was to report the current worldwide practice of liver graft allocation and discuss respective advantages and disadvantages. Methods: Countries around the world that perform 95 or more deceased donor liver transplantations per year were analyzed for donation and allocation policies, as well as recipient characteristics. Results: Most countries use the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, or variations of it, for organ allocation, while some countries opt for center-based allocation systems based on their specific requirements, and some countries combine both a MELD and center-based approach. Both the MELD and center-specific allocation systems have inherent limitations. For example, most countries or allocation systems address the limitations of the MELD system by adding extra points to recipient's laboratory scores based on clinical information. It is also clear from this study that cancer, as an indication for liver transplantation, requires special attention. Conclusion: The sickest first policy is the most reasonable basis for the allocation of liver grafts. While MELD is currently the standard for this model, many adjustments were implemented in most countries. A future globally applicable strategy should combine donor and recipient factors, predicting probability of death on the waiting list, post-transplant survival and morbidity, and perhaps costs. Lay summary: An optimal allocation system for scarce resources should simultaneously ensure maximal utility, but also equity. While the model for end-stage liver disease is currently the standard for this model, many adjustments were implemented in most countries.

abstract = {Hyponatremia is associated with reduced survival in patients with cirrhosis awaiting orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). However, data are sparse regarding the impact of hyponatremia on outcome following OLT. We investigated the effect of hyponatremia at the time of OLT on mortality and morbidity following the procedure. The study included 2,175 primary OLT recipients between 1990 and 2000. Serum sodium concentrations obtained immediately prior to OLT were correlated with subsequent survival using proportional hazards analysis. Morbidity associated with hyponatremia was assessed, including length of hospitalization, length of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and occurrence of central pontine myelinolysis (CPM). Out of 2,175 subjects, 1,495 (68.7{\%}) had normal serum sodium ({\textgreater}135 mEq/L) at OLT, whereas mild hyponatremia (125-134 mEq/L) was present in 615 (28.3{\%}) and severe hyponatremia ({\textless}125 mEq/L) in 65 (3.0{\%}). Serum sodium had no impact on survival up to 90 days after OLT (multivariate hazard ratio = 1.00, P = 0.99). Patients with severe hyponatremia tended to have a longer stay in the ICU (median = 4.5 days) and hospital (17.0 days) compared to normonatremic recipients (median ICU stay = 3.0 days, hospital stay = 14.0 days; P = 0.02 and 0.08, respectively). There were 10 subjects that developed CPM, with an overall incidence of 0.5{\%}. Although infrequent, the incidence of CPM did correlate with serum sodium levels (P {\textless} 0.01). Conclusion: Pre-OLT serum sodium does not have a statistically significant impact on survival following OLT. The incidence of CPM correlates with hyponatremia, although its overall incidence is low. Incorporation of serum sodium in organ allocation may not adversely affect the overall post-OLT outcome. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2009 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.},

abstract = {The vocal quality of a patient is modeled by means of a Dysphonia Severity Index (DSI), which is designed to establish an objective and quantitative correlate of the perceived vocal quality. The DSI is based on the weighted combination of the following selected set of voice measurements: highest frequency (F 0 -High in Hz), lowest intensity (I-Low in dB), maximum phonation time (MPT in s), and jitter ({\%}). The DSI is derived from a multivariate analysis of 387 subjects with the goal of describing, purely based on objective measures, the perceived voice quality. It is constructed as DSI = 0.13 × MPT + 0.0053 × F 0 -High – 0.26 × I-Low – 1.18 × Jitter ({\%}) + 12.4. The DSI for perceptually normal voices equals +5 and for severely dysphonic voices –5. The more negative the patient's index, the worse is his or her vocal quality. As such, the DSI is especially useful to evaluate therapeu-tic evolution of dysphonic patients. Additionally, there is a high correlation between the DSI and the Voice Handicap Index score. V ocal performance has increasingly gained interest in our society, which is evolving into a service-oriented community. This grow-ing interest has consequently induced a lot of multidisciplinary research concerning voice assessment and therapy with a comprehen-sive battery of tests focusing on qualitative and quantitative aspects of vocal performance. The medical diagnosis of vocal fold pathology is mainly based on an endoscopic exam of the vocal folds and upper airway tract. Voice dys-function on the other hand is assessed by perceptual judgment and ob-jective measures, such as acoustic and aerodynamic characteristics. However, perceptual evaluation is one of the most controversial topics in voice research. Review of literature reveals a wide variety of rating scales So far, there is no internationally accepted perceptual judgment protocol, but the GRBAS scale (Grade of hoarseness, R for roughness, B for breathiness, A for astheny, and S for strain) proposed by the Japan Society of Logopaedics Downloaded From: http://jslhr.pubs.asha.org/ by Osamu Shiromoto on 01/20/2016 Terms of Use: http://pubs.asha.org/ss/rights{\_}and{\_}permissions.aspx},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To analyse the aetiological profile and surgical results of patients with acquired chronic subglottic stenosis, and formulate a surgical scheme based on an audit of various surgical procedures.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Thirty patients were treated by 65 procedures (31 endoscopic and 34 external) between 2004 and 2009.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Isolated subglottic stenosis was noted as unusual in the majority (27 cases), demonstrating contiguous tracheal or glottic involvement. The major aetiologies were intubation injury (n = 8) and external injury (n = 21) (i.e. blunt trauma, strangulation or penetrating injury). Vocal fold immobility and cartilage framework involvement were frequent with external injury and infrequent with intubation injury. Luminal restoration was achieved by endoscopic procedures in 2 cases, external procedures in 19 cases, and external plus adjuvant endoscopic procedures in 8 cases. The preferred surgical options were: endoscopic procedures, restricted to short, recent, grade I or II mucosal stenosis cases; and external procedures for all other stenosis situations, including isolated subglottic (anterior cricoid split plus cartilage graft), subglottic and glottic or high subglottic (anterior plus posterior cricoid split with cartilage graft), and subglottic and tracheal (cricotracheal resection with anastomosis).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: External injury stenosis has a worse profile than intubation injury stenosis. Anatomical categorisation of subglottic stenosis guides surgical procedure selection. Endoscopic procedures have limited indications as primary procedures but are useful adjunctive procedures.},

The voice range profiles within the speaking pitch range were defined 10 times in succession and in five sample sessions between 45-minute-long oral readings. Our study followed the ideas of the Gage repeatability and reproducibility design. The results showed that the method used was reliable in fortissimo phonations at four of the measured frequencies.

AIM: To evaluate the characteristics of swallowing after total laryngectomy and pharyngolaryngectomy with pharyngeal T closure, correlating them with the Quality of Life in Swallowing Disorders questionnaire. METHODS: A prospective evaluation was performed in 28 patients; fifteen undergoing total laryngectomy and thirteen undergoing total pharyngolaryngectomy. Swallowing was evaluated through videofluoroscopy regarding the preparatory, oral and pharyngeal phases of swallowing, and the quality of life related to swallowing questionnaire was employed to measure quality of life. RESULTS: Anatomical and functional changes were observed under videofluoroscopic evaluation. Dysphagia was diagnosed in 18 patients (64.3{\%}), being mild in 66.6{\%} and moderate/severe in 33.3{\%}. The questionnaire indicated good quality of life in almost all scales. Complaints of dysphagia were associated to the burden (p=0.036) and mental health scale (p=0.031). The questionnaire indicated impact on the mental health scale for patients with severe dysphagia (p=0.012). CONCLUSIONS: High incidence of dysphagia was observed in some quality of life assessments, especially of mild degree.},

abstract = {It is critical to balance waitlist mortality against posttransplant mortality. Our objective was to devise a scoring system that predicts recipient survival at 3 months following liver transplantation to complement MELD-predicted waitlist mortality. Univariate and multivariate analysis on 21 673 liver transplant recipients identified independent recipient and donor risk factors for posttransplant mortality. A retrospective analysis conducted on 30 321 waitlisted candidates reevaluated the predictive ability of the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. We identified 13 recipient factors, 4 donor factors and 2 operative factors (warm and cold ischemia) as significant predictors of recipient mortality following liver transplantation at 3 months. The Survival Outcomes Following Liver Transplant (SOFT) Score utilized 18 risk factors (excluding warm ischemia) to successfully predict 3-month recipient survival following liver transplantation. This analysis represents a study of waitlisted candidates and transplant recipients of liver allografts after the MELD score was implemented. Unlike MELD, the SOFT score can accurately predict 3-month survival following liver transplantation. The most significant risk factors were previous transplantation and life support pretransplant. The SOFT score can help clinicians determine in real time which candidates should be transplanted with which allografts. Combined with MELD, SOFT can better quantify survival benefit for individual transplant procedures. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

abstract = {Much previous research has demonstrated that listeners do not agree well when using traditional rating scales to measure pathological voice quality. Although these findings may indicate that listeners are inherently unable to agree in their perception of such complex auditory stimuli, another explanation implicates the particular measurement method-rating scale judgments-as the culprit. An alternative method of assessing quality-listener-mediated analysis-synthesis-was devised to assess this possibility. In this new approach, listeners explicitly compare synthetic and natural voice samples, and adjust speech synthesizer parameters to create auditory matches to voice stimuli. This method is designed to replace unstable internal standards for qualities like breathiness and roughness with externally presented stimuli, to overcome major hypothetical sources of disagreement in rating scale judgments. In a preliminary test of the reliability of this method, listeners were asked to adjust the signal-to-noise ratio for 12 synthetic pathological voices so that the resulting stimuli matched the natural target voices as well as possible For comparison to the synthesis judgments, listeners also judged the noisiness of the natural stimuli in a separate task using a traditional visual-analog rating scale. For 9 of the 12 voices, agreement among listeners was significantly (and substantially) greater for the synthesis task than for the rating scale task. Response variances for the two tasks did not differ for the remaining three voices. However, a second experiment showed that the synthesis settings that listeners selected for these three voices were within a difference limen, and therefore observed differences were perceptually insignificant. These results indicate that listeners can in fact agree in their perceptual assessments of voice quality, and that analysis-synthesis can measure perception reliably.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to find a correlation between closure technique in pharyngeal closure and outcomes of both pharyngocutaneous fistula and post-laryngectomy stricture after laryngectomy. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective Chart Review. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a total of 151 patients over a 20-year period from January 1994 to December of 2013 who underwent primary pharyngeal reconstruction after total laryngectomy specifically looking at the closure technique in relation to pharyngo-cutaneous fistula (PCF) and post-laryngectomy stricture postoperatively. Patients were excluded based on secondary pharyngeal closure. Using logistic regression modelling, we performed univariate and multivariate analyses of our data. RESULTS: The overall PCF and post-laryngectomy stricture rates were 19.1{\%} and 15.8{\%}. When salvage laryngectomy was excluded, t-type closure had a significantly lower risk of fistula rate (P=.038) compared to vertical closure. In multivariate analysis, this statistical significance was lost (P=.23); however, non-salvage t-type closure remained significantly better than both salvage laryngectomy groups (t-type, P=.033, vertical, P=.037), while non-salvage vertical closure had no significant difference from other groups. There was no difference in stricture rate between the two closure techniques (P=.63). CONCLUSION: Our study supports the role of t-type closure decreasing fistula rates in primary pharyngeal reconstruction. Orientation of the pharyngeal closure does not appear to change the risk of post-laryngectomy stricture formation after total laryngectomy. Salvage laryngectomy with primary pharyngeal reconstruction remains an independent risk factor for fistula formation.},

abstract = {Background. Salivary fistula is a common complication after salvage total laryngectomy. Previous studies have not considered the number of layers of pharyngeal closure and have not classified fistulas according to severity. Our objective was to analyze our institutional experience with salvage total laryngectomy, categorize salivary fistulas based on severity, and study the effect of various pharyngeal closure techniques on fistula incidence. Methods. Retrospective analysis of 48 patients who underwent salvage total laryngectomy, comparing pharyngeal closure technique and use of a pectoralis major flap with regard to salivary fistula rate. Fistulas were categorized into major and minor fistulas based on whether operative intervention was required. Results. The major fistula rate was 18.8{\%} (9/48) and the minor fistula rate was 29.2{\%} (14/48). The overall (major plus minor) fistula rate was 47.9{\%}. The overall fistula and major fistula rates decreased with increasing the number of closure layers and with use of a pectoralis major flap; however, these correlations did not reach statistical significance. Other than age, there were no clinicopathologic variables associated with salivary fistulas. Conclusion. For salvage total laryngectomies, increasing the number of closure layers or use of a pectoralis major flap may reduce the risk of salivary fistula.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To evaluate the outcomes of transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) for T1 glottic carcinoma using longitudinal voice analysis. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of medical records. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 57 patients (50 T1a, seven T1b) who underwent TLM for T1 glottic carcinoma, and longitudinal voice analysis was performed before surgery, during the early postoperative period (within 3 months), and during the late postoperative period (more than 6 months). Acoustic, perceptual (Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, Strain scale), and subjective voice analysis using the Voice Handicap Index (VHI) was conducted. RESULTS: Voice quality deteriorated in the early postoperative period in terms of several parameters. However, no significant differences in voice quality were observed in the late postoperative period, whereas Grade (from 1.85 +/- 0.83 to 1.50 +/- 0.90) and Roughness (from 1.74 +/- 0.73 to 1.48 +/- 0.87) had improved significantly. Patients who underwent lesser-extent cordectomy (type I, II) showed improvement in VHI-Physical (from 12.93 +/- 11.10 to 6.07 +/- 8.69) and Grade (from 1.60 +/- 0.68 to 0.98 +/- 0.83), whereas improvement was not identified in those who underwent larger-extent cordectomy (type III, IV, V). Improvement in Grade (from 1.70 +/- 0.80 to 1.23 +/- 0.91) and Roughness (from 1.77 +/- 0.73 to 1.25 +/- 0.76) was identified in patients who had unilateral tumor without involvement of anterior commissure. However, those with involvement of the anterior commissure or bilateral vocal cord showed a tendency toward deterioration in voice quality. CONCLUSIONS: Voice quality of patients following TLM for T1 glottic carcinoma may improve significantly over time in cases with lesser-extent types of cordectomy or unilateral tumor without involvement of the anterior commissure.

The aim of this study was to assess the vocal function of patients who had undergone CO2 laser cordectomy. DESIGN: Retrospective, observational and control group study, conducted in a tertiary care medical department. METHODS: One hundred and thirty-five male patients (age range 36-83 years) underwent different types of endoscopic cordectomy. Forty age-matched, euphonic male subjects were selected as controls. Patients were classified according to the main site of the phonatory neo-glottis. Outcome measures were maximum phonation time, vocal intensity and harmonic/noise ratio. Mann-Whitney and rank Spearman tests were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Findings indicated statistically significant differences for all parameters, comparing patients and controls (p{\textless}0.001), and a direct positive relation between type of functional compensation and outcome measures in the study patients (p{\textless}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that functional compensation and outcome measures were related, and that no functional compensation enabled the study patients to achieve a voice quality comparable with that of controls.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to establish the incidence, risk factors, and the management of pharyngocutaneous fistula (PCF) after primary and salvage total laryngectomy. A retrospective, match-paired analysis of 86 patients who developed fistula after total laryngectomy was carried out and compared with a control group of 86 patients without fistula, randomly selected from a pool of 352 total laryngectomies, performed between January 1999 to October 2014. The overall incidence of PCF in the series was 24.4{\%}; we recorded rates of 19.0{\%}, 28.6{\%} and 30.3{\%} following primary total laryngectomy (PTL), salvage laryngectomy post-radiotherapy (RT-STL) and salvage laryngectomy postchemoradiotherapy (CRT-STL), respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that the relative risk of fistula was respectively 2.47, 3.09 and 7.69 for hypoalbuminaemia {\textless}/=3.5 g/dL, RT-STL and CRT-STL. An early onset of PCF within 10 postoperative days was recorded in case of salvage total laryngectomy. The management of PCF significantly differed between PTL, RT-STL and CTRT-STL, with exclusive conservative treatment for PTL (93.55{\%}), while in the CRT-STL group surgical closure with regional flaps (58.82{\%}) prevailed. Conservative management, adjuvant hyperbaric oxygen therapy and surgical closure were equally distributed in the RT-STL group. Thorough knowledge of patient-related risk factors and its prognostic value, allows the surgeon to better evaluate preventive strategies with the aim of minimising fistula formation, hospitalisation times and related costs.},

abstract = {Medialization laryngoplasty with Silastic (MLS) has become the mainstay of treatment for patients with unilateral vocal fold paralysis. However, a significant number of these patients undergoing MLS fail to achieve near normal voice quality, because of the fact that medialization alone often fails to adduct the arytenoid. Without adduction of the arytenoid, the vocal fold fails to achieve the physiologic phonating position. In this subset of patients, the addition of arytenoid adduction to MLS results in a significantly stronger voice and less vocal fatigue. This discussion based on over 125 patients undergoing arytenoid adduction (AA), emphasizes the surgical technique of performing AA in conjunction with MLS. {\textcopyright} 1999 W.B.

Little information is known about the incidence of ML/AA surgery nationwide, in particular the success and complication rates., METHODS: A 25-item questionnaire was mailed to 6,644 Board-certified otolaryngologists., RESULTS: The response rate was 25.7{\%} (n = 1,707). Sixty-three percent perform ML and/or AA, representing 29,748 procedures. Experience with Silastic medialization implants has decreased over time, while utilization of other materials has increased. The overall complication rate was 15{\%}, including 0.8{\%} implant extrusion and 6{\%} revision rates. The most common revision was placement of a larger implant (37{\%} of all revisions). Airway compromise requiring intervention was observed in 2.2{\%}, and suboptimal voice outcome in 4{\%}. Although not statistically significant, a trend was observed of decreasing complication rate with increasing experience., CONCLUSIONS: Laryngeal framework surgeries are being performed with increasing frequency in the United States. The overall complication rate is slightly increased in the present study, but airway compromise and poor vocal outcome are decreased, and the need for revision surgery is unchanged. These findings suggest a continued high level of efficacy of these procedures.},

abstract = {Factors underlying voice disorders can be cate- gorized into three distinct domains: emotional, physical, and functional. The Voice Handicap Index (VHI) subjec- tively evaluates voice disorders in terms of these three fac- tors. On the other hand, Voice Laboratory Measurements (VLM) use objective criteria to evaluate the severity of voice disorders. Use of these two different tests (VHI and VLM) on dysphonic patients has, however, tended to yield results that vary widely in their conclusions. This re- port reviewed 135 testing sessions on dysphonia patients. Seventy-nine of the tests were VHI, and 56 were VLM. All VHI and VLM parameters were entered into a statisti- cal program and analyzed using a Pearson correlation. The results show that each VHI parameter provides a sig- nificant level of reliability (P {\textless} 0.01) when compared with other VHI parameters. Four VLM parameters also demonstrated significant reliability (P {\textless} 0.01) in compar- ison with other VLM parameters. However, when com- paring across testing methods, VHI and VLM parameter reliability is shown to be poor (P {\textgreater} 0.05). With such a large discrepancy between the results of VHI and VLM testing, no objective parameter can yet be regarded as a definitive prognostic factor in a subjective evaluation of dysphonic patients.},

@article{Alukal2020,
abstract = {Hyponatremia is frequently seen in patients with ascites secondary to advanced cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Although not apparent in the early stages of cirrhosis, the progression of cirrhosis and portal hypertension leads to splanchnic vasodilation, and this leads to the activation of compensatory mechanisms such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), sympathetic nervous system, and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) to ameliorate low circulatory volume. The net effect is the avid retention of sodium and water to compensate for the low effective circulatory volume, resulting in the development of ascites. These compensatory mechanisms lead to impairment of the kidneys to eliminate solute-free water in decompensated cirrhosis. Nonosmotic secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as arginine vasopressin, further worsens excess water retention and thereby hyponatremia. The management of hyponatremia in this setting is a challenge as conventional therapies for hyponatremia including fluid restriction and correction of hypokalemia are frequently inefficacious. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiology, complications, and various treatment modalities, including albumin infusion, selective vasopressin receptor antagonists, or hypertonic saline for patients with severe hyponatremia and those awaiting liver transplantation.},

All patients had histologically verified invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Fifteen male patients (mean age 63.9 years) without laryngeal disorders were used as controls. Voice recordings prior to treatment, and both at 3 months and at 2 years after completed treatment were analyzed. Acoustic measures of shimmer, jitter, breathiness, harmonic-to-noise ratio and fundamental frequency (F0) average were calculated with the Soundscope program. Two plain measures were also used: time required to read a running speech voice sample, and number of breaths. Perceptual voice analysis was performed blindly by two groups of listeners, Group A (4 experienced listeners) and Group B (4 naive listeners). Group A estimated quality of voice according to a modified GRBAS score, whereas Group B estimated Grade only. We found voice quality both at 3 months and at 2 years after radiotherapy to be significantly better than after laser treatment, as assessed by the acoustic variables breathiness, jitter, F0 average, running speech voice sample reading time and number of breaths. The perceptual variables Grade (Group A and B), Breathiness, Asthenia and Strain were also significantly better after radiotherapy.},

abstract = {Glucocorticoids (GCC) generally are administered to patients with brain tumors to relieve neurological symptoms by decreasing the water content in a peritumoral zone of edema. We hypothesized that diffusion imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values could detect subtle changes of water content in brain tumors and in peritumoral edema after GCC therapy. The study consisted of 13 patients with intra-axial brain tumor, and ADC was measured in the tumor, within peritumoral edema, and in normal white matter remote from the tumor before and after GCC therapy. ADC also was measured in normal white matter in four control patients with no intracranial disease who were treated with GCC for other indications. Conventional MR images showed no visually evident interval change in tumor size or the extent of peritumoral edema in any subject after GCC therapy, which nonetheless resulted in a decrease in mean ADC of 7.0{\%} in tumors (P {\textless} 0.05), 1.8{\%} in peritumoral edema (P {\textgreater} 0.05, not significant) and 5.8{\%} in normal white matter (P {\textless} 0.05). In patients with no intracranial disease, GCC therapy decreased mean ADC in white matter by 5.4{\%} (P {\textless} 0.05). ADC measurement can demonstrate subtle changes in the brain after GCC therapy that cannot be observed by conventional MR imaging. Measurement of ADC proved to be a sensitive means of assessing the effect of GCC therapy, even in the absence of visually discernible changes in conventional MR images.},

abstract = {In order to minimize neurological symptoms and treatment-related side-effects, patients with primary or secondary brain tumors receive dexamethasone. The goal of this study was to analyze dosage and duration of dexamethasone intake and to compare the advantages and disadvantages of this medication during the course of radiation therapy (RT). Data from 138 consecutive patients were therefore analyzed retrospectively. During the course of therapy, the dosage of dexamethasone was evaluated, as were the indications for and duration of this treatment, its side-effects and any clinical changes reported during dexamethasone intake. The dosage of dexamethasone was higher at the outset and during RT (median 7-12 mg/day) than at the end of RT (median 1-6 mg/day). The average duration of dexamethasone intake was 23 weeks for patients with primary, and 7 weeks for patients with secondary brain tumors. The most frequent side-effects were a rise in serum glucose level, peripheral edema, psychiatric disorders, and Cushing's syndrome. Life-threatening complications remained rare. Initially, dexamethasone led to good clinical improvement with few side-effects of RT, whereas by the end of RT the symptom relief was slight and toxicity increased. In a group of 13 patients who received no dexamethasone during RT, 12 showed neither RT-related side-effects nor of neurological impairment. Dexamethasone effectively minimizes neurological symptoms and RT-related side-effects in patients with primary and secondary brain tumors. Nevertheless, the side-effects of dexamethasone itself increase over time. For this reason, a generalized dose scheme should not be used. Instead, dosage should be adapted to each patient's individual needs. Future prospective studies will have to determine whether dexamethasone is advantageous on balance or not.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To study differences in tumour capillary permeability as expressed by the unidirectional transport rate constant Ki, extracellular distribution volume Vd and relaxation time T1 in human intracranial tumours using a recently described MRI method, and apply the model to study differences in these parameters after glucocorticoid (GC) treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventeen brain tumour patients were studied. There were seven glioblastoma (GLI), four metastasis (MET), and six meningioma (MM) patients. Nine patients were studied before and after an average of 6 days of GC treatment. A 1.5 Tesla MR imaging scanner was used, and a two compartment diffusion model for Gd-DTPA was applied. RESULTS: There was a significant difference between pre-treatment Ki in GLI's and MM's, MM's having the highest permeability. There were no significant differences between pre-treatment Vd or T1 among the different tumour types. After GC treatment Ki decreased 15{\%} on average (52{\%} in GLI's and MET's, but only 4{\%} in MM's). Vd decreased 14{\%} on average in all tumours, but 47{\%} in GLI's and MET's (p {\textless} 0.04), but increased 2{\%} during treatment of MM's. T1 decreased 9{\%} in all tumours (p {\textless} 0.04), but 11{\%} in GLI's and MET's (p {\textless} 0.003), and only 6{\%} in MM's. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to estimate Ki, Vd and T1 simultaneously in brain tumour patients in a clinical MRI system. Ki was significantly higher in MM's compared to GLI's and MET's suggesting that MM's differ in some physiological parameter at the blood-tumour interface. MM's did not respond to GC treatment, neither in Ki, Vd nor in T1, whereas GLI's and MET's primarily decreased their extracellular distribution volume, suggesting that this may be an important effect in GC's mode of action in these tumour types.},

Seventy-five patients (65{\%}) were attending schools, 27 of whom were 2 years or more below the age-appropriate level. Of the remaining 41 patients, 26 had a job and 15 were unemployed. Poor compliance with medications was reported by 52 patients (45{\%}). Alcohol consumption was lower than in the reference population (p {\textless} 0.001). Anxiety, loneliness and negative thoughts were expressed by 53, 84 and 47{\%} of the participants, respectively. Thirteen patients (11{\%}) were being cared for by psychologists or psychiatrists. The 65 nonparticipants had greater psychological problems than the participants, and a lower educational level. In conclusion, after LT in early life, most patients displayed psychological vulnerability during early adulthood. The educational level of patients was lower than that of theirs peers. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the effect of voice rehabilitation on health-related quality of life (HRQL) and communication experience for laryngeal cancer patients treated with radiotherapy. METHOD: This prospective randomised controlled trial included 74 patients with Tis-T4 laryngeal cancer treated curatively by radiotherapy, of which 37 constituted the intervention group receiving voice rehabilitation and 37 patients as a control group. Patients were followed at one and six months post-radiotherapy, with voice rehabilitation conducted between these time-points. Endpoints included patient reported outcomes, including HRQL as measured by European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Core30 (C30) and Head {\&} Neck35 (H{\&}N35) as well as communication function as measured by Swedish Self-Evaluation of Communication Experiences after Laryngeal cancer (S-SECEL). RESULTS: The intervention group reported statistically significant improvements in communication experience as measured by S-SECEL environmental, attitudinal and total score domains compared to the control group. Similar improvements were seen in EORTC H{\&}N35 Speech domain and the EORTC C30 domain Global quality of life. Moderate correlations were noted (r = 0.51-0.59) between three of four S-SECEL domains and the EORTC domains Speech and Global quality of life. CONCLUSION: Laryngeal cancer patients treated with radiotherapy who receive voice rehabilitation appear to experience beneficial effects on communication function and selected HRQL domains. Voice rehabilitation following radiotherapy is recommended but further research investigating potential target groups and long-term effects is required.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the oncological and voice outcomes of transoral laser microsurgery for tumour stage T1b stage glottic cancer patients. METHODS: A prospective cohort study in a tertiary care head and neck cancer centre included tumour-node-metastasis stage T1bN0M0 glottic cancer patients scheduled to undergo transoral laser microsurgery from January 2002 until June 2014. Kaplan-Meier five-year analyses of local control, overall survival, disease-specific survival and laryngeal preservation were performed. Voice Handicap Index-10 scores and maximum phonation times were also recorded. RESULTS: Twenty-one participants with a mean age of 66.8 years were enrolled. The mean follow up was 56.5 months. Kaplan-Meier 5-year survival analysis illustrated a local control rate of 82 per cent, overall survival of 88 per cent, disease-specific survival of 100 per cent, and laryngeal preservation of 100 per cent. The pre-operative Voice Handicap Index-10 score was 19.1 +/- 9.47 (mean +/- standard deviation (SD)) and the post-operative scores were 13.5 +/- 9.29 at three months, 10.44 +/- 9.70 at one year and 5.83 +/- 4.91 at two years. The pre-operative maximum phonation time was 16.23 +/- 5.46 seconds (mean +/- SD) and the post-operative values were 14.44 +/- 6.73 seconds at three months, 15.27 +/- 5.71 seconds at one year and 14.33 +/- 6.44 seconds at two years. CONCLUSION: Transoral laser microsurgery yields relatively high rates of oncological control and acceptable voice outcomes, and thus shows utility as a primary treatment modality for T1b glottic cancer},

abstract = {Facial neuropathy, or seventh cranial neuropathy, is the most common cranial neuropathy. The anatomy of the facial nerve is rather complex for a cranial nerve, with a long intracranial course, in which the nerve takes three bends (or genu). Electrodiagnosis can be helpful in prognosis, but not before several days. Imaging is rarely indicated in Bell's palsy, but is often abnormal nonetheless, and can be very useful in other causes of facial neuropathy. The clinical presentation is of unilateral facial weakness of upper and lower face, hyperacusis, dysgeusia, and disordered lacrimation and salivation. Many different disease processes can result in facial neuropathy, but 70{\%} of cases are idiopathic, or as it is best known, Bell's palsy. Ramsay Hunt syndrome, defined as facial neuropathy with herpes zoster oticus, is another common cause. Steroids given acutely are beneficial in improving outcome in Bell's palsy, and antiviral therapy seems helpful in more severe cases. Antiviral therapy is definitely helpful in Ramsay Hunt disease when given within 3 days of onset. Antibiotics are helpful in Lyme facial neuropathy, which has a very good prognosis.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The objective was to develop an abbreviated voice handicap assessment instrument and compare it with the Voice Handicap Index (VHI). STUDY DESIGN: Item analysis of the VHI in individuals without voice disorders and patients with voice disorders and creation and validation of the abbreviated VHI. METHODS: Clinical consensus review of the VHI items was held to prioritize the clinical value of each of the VHI items (30 items in all). Item analysis of the VHI was performed using the VHI responses of 100 patients with voice problems and 159 control subjects. The 10 most robust VHI items were selected using the item analysis and clinical consensus results to form the Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10). Statistical analysis comparing the validity of the VHI-10 with the VHI was performed with 819 patients representing a wide spectrum of voice disorders. RESULTS: Statistical analysis of the VHI and VHI-10 scores from the study group showed no statistically significant differences between the VHI and the VHI-10. Irrespective of diagnosis, the correlation between the VHI and the VHI-10 was greater than .90 (P = .01). The ratios of the VHI-10 to VHI scores for a variety of voice disorder categories were analyzed and found to be consistently greater than the expected value (33{\%}). This suggests that the VHI-10 may be a more robust instrument than the VHI. CONCLUSION: The VHI-10 is a powerful representation of the VHI that takes less time for the patient to complete without loss of validity. Thus, the VHI-10 can replace the VHI as an instrument to quantify patients' perception of their voice handicap.},

abstract = {Objectives/Hypothesis—The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical effectiveness of type I thyroplasty, injection laryngoplasty and graft implantation for the treatment of vocal fold scar and pathologic sulcus vocalis. Study Design—Prospective, multi-arm, quasi-experimental research design. Methods—Twenty-eight patients with newly diagnosed vocal fold scar and/or pathologic sulcus vocalis were assigned to one of three treatment modalities: Type I thyroplasty (n = 9), injection laryngoplasty (n = 9) and graft implantation (n = 10). Psychosocial, auditory-perceptual, acoustic, aerodynamic and videostroboscopic data were collected pre-treatment and at 1, 6, 12 and 18 months post-treatment. Results—Type I thyroplasty and graft implantation both resulted in reduced voice handicap with no concomitant improvement in auditory-perceptual, acoustic, aerodynamic or vocal fold physiologic performance. Injection laryngoplasty resulted in no improvement on any vocal function index. Patients who underwent graft implantation exhibited the slowest improvement trajectory across the 18 month follow-up period. Conclusions—A persistent challenge in this area is that no single treatment modality is successful for the majority of patients, and there is no evidence-based decision algorithm for matching a given treatment to a given patient. Progress therefore requires the identification and categorization of predictive clinical features that can drive evidence-based treatment assignment.},

METHODS All related studies published up to October 2016 were acquired by searching PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane were conducted by two authors, with the index words: vocal, glottis, larynx, laser, surgery, cordectomy, radiotherapy, radiation, irradiation, carcinoma, and cancer. Relative studies which compared oncologic outcomes between LS and RT were included. RESULTS A total of nine eligible studies were included for the analysis, which contained two prospective studies and seven retrospective studies. LS has increased larynx preservation (OR = 3.86, 95{\%} CI = 1.47-10.13, p = .006) compared with RT group. No statistical difference was observed between LS group and RT group in terms of local control, overall survival, and disease-specific survival. There was a slight trend in terms of local control, overall survival, and disease-specific survival that all favored LS, although all data did not reach the level of statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS The results of this meta-analysis indicate that LS may be a better option for the treatment of T1a glottic carcinoma because patients underwent LS may benefit from increased larynx preservation compared with RT. However, more multi-center randomized controlled trials would be urgently needed to prove these differences.},

abstract = {Objective: The objectives of this study were to assess the influence of the different types of laser cordectomy on vocal outcome and highlight the relationship between some perceptive, acoustic, and endoscopic evaluations. Study Design: Retrospective observational study. Methods: Thirteen patients, staged as having T1a tumor, underwent laser CO2cordectomy (1 patient type I and type II, 2 patients type II, 6 patients type III, and 4 patients type IV) between January and June 2010. Grade, roughness, breathiness, asthenia, and strain evaluation scale; voice handicap index-10 questionnaire; multidimensional computer analysis of voice and speech; maximum phonation time; and stroboscopic examination were performed 12 months after the surgery. Correlations between jitter{\%} and R, shimmer{\%} and R, noise-to-harmonic ratio (NHR) and G were studied. Patients were first divided into groups according to type of cordectomy performed and, later, according to stroboscopic findings. Wilcoxon test, Spearman index, and Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by post hoc analysis, were used. Results: No significant differences were found in type III and type IV cordectomy groups. Jitter{\%} and R values showed a correlation as did shimmer{\%} and B values, and NHR and G values in type III cordectomy group. Moreover, shimmer{\%} and NHR values significantly increase in direct proportion to the severity of the endoscopic status. Conclusions: Results indicate that the type of surgery performed, functional compensation, and outcome measures were related, although for some data, there were no statistical evidence. Individual compliance could strongly influence vocal outcome in these patients. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Voice Foundation.},

Methods A total of 244 patients older than 50 years of age were divided into 3 groups according to age at procedure (50 to 59 years: n = 69; 60 to 74 years: n = 120; 75 years and older: n = 55). The primary endpoint was defined as all-cause mortality and hospitalization due to heart failure or stroke. Improvements in functional capacity and cardiac remodeling after the procedure were also assessed. Results During a median follow-up of 36 months, mortality and hospitalization due to heart failure or stroke occurred in 18 patients (7{\%}). Among patients older than 75 years of age, 2 died of noncardiovascular disease, 2 were hospitalized due to heart failure, and 1 had a stroke. More than 90{\%} of patients older than 75 years of age did not experience these events. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the event-free survival rate was not different among the 3 age groups (log-rank test, p = 0.780). New York Heart Association functional class and right ventricular/left ventricular end-diastolic diameter ratio improved in patients older than 75 years of age, similar to the other age groups. Conclusions Long-term outcome after transcatheter ASD closure in patients older than 75 years of age is similar to that in the other, relatively younger age groups. This suggests that transcatheter ASD closure can be considered a valuable therapeutic option in patients older than 75 years of age.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The tracheoesophageal puncture technique of voice restoration enables successful voice rehabilitation after total laryngectomy. Because post-operative voice quality can vary significantly, depending on which type of hypopharyngeal repair is chosen, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of such repair on tracheoesophageal puncture voice after total laryngectomy. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, clinical study. SETTING: Otolaryngology department, Tanta University, Egypt. METHODS: Tracheoesophageal puncture voice was quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated in 40 patients using a Provox 2TM prosthesis after standard total laryngectomy. The patients were divided, according to the type of hypopharyngeal repair, into four groups of 10 cases each, as follows: group one, pharyngoesophageal myotomy; group two, pharyngeal plexus neurectomy; group three, non-muscle vertical repair; and group four, transverse repair. These surgical groups were compared with each other with respect to different voice parameters. RESULTS: Patient profiles were almost equivalent in all surgical groups. The mean values of most of the parameters of quantitative tracheoesophageal puncture voice did not differ significantly, comparing the four surgical groups; however, a slightly significant difference was observed regarding loud intensity in the non-muscle repair group, and soft and loud jitter in the transverse repair group. Mean values for qualitative measures of intelligibility and communicative effectiveness did not show significant difference. However, a slightly significant difference was observed regarding fluency, word correctness, speaking rate and wetness, with higher values for all these parameters except wetness in the myotomy group, and higher values for wetness in the non-muscle repair group. CONCLUSION: The four hypopharyngeal repair types--primary pharyngoesophageal myotomy, pharyngeal plexus neurectomy, non-muscle vertical repair and transverse hypopharyngeal repair--were almost equivalent in prevention of pharyngoesophageal spasm in total laryngectomy patients who had undergone primary tracheoesophageal puncture for voice restoration.},

abstract = {To survey the burden of liver disease in Europe and its causes 260 epidemiological studies published in the last five years were reviewed. The incidence and prevalence of cirrhosis and primary liver cancer are key to understand the burden of liver disease. They represent the end-stage of liver pathology and thus are indicative of the associated mortality. About 0.1{\%} of Hungarian males will die of cirrhosis every year compared with 0.001{\%} of Greek females. WHO estimate that liver cancer is responsible for around 47,000 deaths per year in the EU. Harmful alcohol consumption, viral hepatitis B and C and metabolic syndromes related to overweight and obesity are the leading causes of cirrhosis and primary liver cancer in Europe. Chronic hepatitis B affects 0.5-0.7{\%} of the European population. In the last decade the prevalence of chronic hepatitis C was 0.13-3.26{\%}. It is of great concern that about 90{\%} of people in Europe infected by viral hepatitis are unaware of their status. Available data suggest the prevalence rate of NAFLD is 2-44{\%} in the general European population (including obese children) and 42.6-69.5{\%} in people with type 2 diabetes. Each of these four major causes of liver disease is amenable to prevention and treatment, reducing the burden of liver disease in Europe and saving lives. Further surveys are urgently needed to implement cost-effective prevention programmes and novel treatments to tackle this problem.},

abstract = {Multi-state models are a very useful tool to answer a wide range of questions in survival analysis that cannot, or only in a more complicated way, be answered by classical models. They are suitable for both biomedical and other applications in which time-to-event variables are analyzed. However, they are still not frequently applied. So far, an important reason for this has been the lack of available software. To overcome this problem, we have developed the mstate package in R for the analysis of multi-state models. The package covers all steps of the analysis of multi-state models, from model building and data preparation to estimation and graphical representation of the results. It can be applied to non- and semi-parametric (Cox) models. The package is also suitable for competing risks models, as they are a special category of multi-state models. This article offers guidelines for the actual use of the software by means of an elaborate multi-state analysis of data describing post-transplant events of patients with blood cancer. The data have been provided by the EBMT (the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation). Special attention will be paid to the modeling of different covariate effects (the same for all transitions or transition-specific) and different baseline hazard assumptions (different for all transitions or equal for some).},

abstract = {Purpose—Competing risks observations, where patients are subject to a number of potential failure events, are a feature of most clinical cancer studies. With competing risks, several modeling approaches are available to evaluate the relationship of covariates to cause-specific failures. We discuss the use and interpretation of commonly used competing risks regression models. Experimental Design—For competing risks analysis, the influence of covariate can be evaluated in relation to cause-specific hazard or on the cumulative incidence of the failure types. We present simulation studies to illustrate how covariate effects differ between these approaches. We then show the implications of model choice in an example from a Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) clinical trial for prostate cancer. Results—The simulation studies illustrate that, depending on the relationship of a covariate to both the failure type of principal interest and the competing failure type, different models can result in substantially different effects. For example, a covariate that has no direct influence on the hazard of a primary event can still be significantly associated with the cumulative probability of that event, if the covariate influences the hazard of a competing event. This is a logical consequence of a fundamental difference between the model formulations. The example from RTOG similarly shows differences in the influence of age and tumor grade depending on the endpoint and the model type used. Conclusions—Competing risks regression modeling requires that one consider the specific question of interest and subsequent choice of the best model to address it.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Glottic leakage during phonation is a direct consequence of unilateral vocal fold (VF) paralysis. This air leakage can be in the horizontal plane and in the vertical plane. Presently, there is no easily applicable medical device allowing noninvasive, office-based measurement of the relative vertical position of the VFs. The larynx ruler (LR) is a laser-based measuring device that could meet the previously stated need, using a flexible endoscope. This study represents a proof of concept regarding the use of the LR in assessing VF relative positions in the vertical plane. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One fresh male human cadaver larynx, free of neurologic and anatomic disease, was explored with the LR system through the operative channel of a flexible gastroenterology video-endoscope. The tip of the video-endoscope was located in the laryngeal vestibule. The right crico-arytenoid joint was posteriorly disarticulated. Tilting of the VF was obtained by pulling or pushing the arytenoid cartilage with a mosquito forceps fixed to the stump of the previously sectioned superior tip of the posterior crico-arytenoid muscle allowing anterior and posterior tilting of the arytenoid cartilage in order to induce an elevation or a depression of the VF process. Ten "push" and ten "pull" sessions were performed. The distance from the tip of the video-endoscope to each illuminated pixel of the laser beam was recorded. The level difference between the left and right VFs was measured for each recording. RESULTS: Data provided by the LR were consistently in accordance with the movements applied on the VFs. The accuracy of 0.2 mm of the LR is compatible with the envisioned applications for the human larynx. CONCLUSION: The LR system represents a feasible technique to evaluate respective vertical position of VFs in the human larynx. Technical limitations were identified that will require improvements before experimental use on human beings.},

abstract = {The use of stapling devices to close hypopharyngeal defects was first published in 1969 but the technique does not seem to have gained much popularity among head and neck surgeons. Fifty-nine hypopharyngeal defects were closed using a linear stapler between January, 1984, and April, 1989, at the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery of the University Hospital of Zurich. Twenty closures were performed following resection of hypopharyngeal diverticula, 39 following wide field laryngectomy. A total of 10 salivary fistulae was observed: 2 after diverticulectomy (10{\%}), 3 after laryngectomy in nonirradiated patients (11{\%}), and 5 after laryngectomy in irradiated patients (45{\%}). These fistula rates are comparable with average rates quoted in the literature. Only after laryngectomy for radiation failure was the fistula rate unusually high. No other complications were seen that could have been attributed to this type of pharyngeal closure. Closure of a hypopharyngeal defect with a stapler is easier and faster than with traditional suture methods. Provided the patient has not been previously irradiated, staple closure of the hypopharynx appears to be as reliable as closure by standard techniques and can be safely recommended.},

Acoustic parameters of tracheoesophageal voice were compared. RESULTS: Most acoustic parameters were almost equivalent for the two groups, although significant differences were seen for loud intensity, dynamic range, shimmer, loud fundamental frequency, loud jitter, fluency and speaking rate. One post-operative pharyngocutaneous fistula (6.6 per cent) occurred in each group, and resolved with conservative measures.

abstract = {We are pleased to add this typescript to the Bone Marrow Transplantation Statistics Series. We realize the term cubic splines may be a bit off-putting to some readers, but stay with us and don't get lost in polynomial equations. What the authors describe is important conceptually and in practice. Have you ever tried to buy a new pair of hiking boots? Getting the correct fit is critical; shoes that are too small or too large will get you in big trouble! Now imagine if hiking shoes came in only 2 sizes, small and large, and your foot size was somewhere in between. You are in trouble. Sailing perhaps? Transplant physicians are often interested in the association between two variables, say pre-transplant measurable residual disease (MRD) test state and an outcome, say cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR). We typically reduce the results of an MRD test to a binary, negative or positive, often defined by an arbitrary cut-point. However, MRD state is a continuous biological variable, and reducing it to a binary discards what may be important, useful data when we try to correlate it with CIR. Put otherwise, we may miss the trees from the forest. Another way to look at splines is a technique to make smooth curves out of irregular data points. Consider, for example, trying to describe the surface of an egg. You could do it with a series of straight lines connecting points on the egg surface but a much better representation would be combining groups of points into curves and then combining the curves. To prove this try drawing an egg using the draw feature in Microsoft Powerpoint; you are making splines. Gauthier and co-workers show us how to use cubic splines to get the maximum information from data points, which may, unkindly, not lend themselves to dichotomization or a best fit line. Please read on. We hope readers will find their typescript interesting and exciting, and that it will give them a new way to think about how to analyse data. And no, a spline is not a bunch of cactus spines. Robert Peter Gale, Imperial College London, and Mei-Jie Zhang, Medical College of Wisconsin and CIBMTR.},

The differences between groups with and without granulation tissue were significant for P aeruginosa. Polymerase chain reaction fingerprinting of the S aureus obtained from 15 stents (n = 3 patients) revealed a total of seven different genotypes. Whereas two of these patients harbored six different genotypes of S aureus, the third patient was persistently colonized by S aureus over a 15-month period with the identical genotype. Susceptibility testing showed most commonly (65{\%}) sensitivity to a combination of amoxicillin-clavulanate and ofloxacin. After sterilization, 92{\%} of analyzed stent segments showed no bacterial growth. CONCLUSIONS: Granulation tissue commonly occurred next to the silicone (subglottic area, stoma) where S aureus and P aeruginosa were commonly isolated. A combination of mechanical irritation and bacterial infection seems to account for the development of granulation tissue. Polymerase chain reaction fingerprinting showed both prolonged persistence and a change of colonizing strains after multiple stent replacements. A combination of amoxicillin-clavulanate and ofloxacin is the most effective antibiotic therapy. Sterilization of the cost-intensive silicone stents is feasible, and reuse in the same patient is justifiable from economic aspects},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This paper describes recent advances in perceptual, acoustic, aerodynamic, and endoscopic imaging methods for assessing voice function.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRECENT FINDINGS: We review advances from four major areas. PERCEPTUAL ASSESSMENT: Speech-language pathologists are being encouraged to use the new consensus auditory-perceptual evaluation of voice inventory for auditory-perceptual assessment of voice quality, and recent studies have provided new insights into listener reliability issues that have plagued subjective perceptual judgments of voice quality. ACOUSTIC ASSESSMENT: Progress is being made on the development of algorithms that are more robust for analyzing disordered voices, including the capability to extract voice quality-related measures from running speech segments. AERODYNAMIC ASSESSMENT: New devices for measuring phonation threshold air pressures and air flows have the potential to serve as sensitive indices of glottal phonatory conditions, and recent developments in aeroacoustic theory may provide new insights into laryngeal sound production mechanisms. ENDOSCOPIC IMAGING: The increased light sensitivity of new ultra high-speed color digital video processors is enabling high-quality endoscopic imaging of vocal fold tissue motion at unprecedented image capture rates, which promises to provide new insights into the mechanisms of normal and disordered voice production.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUMMARY: Some of the recent research advances in voice function assessment could be more readily adopted into clinical practice, whereas others will require further development.},

Participants were asked to read a sample passage aloud, and acoustic analysis was performed. The main results were as follows: (1) Males exhibited no significant trend for SFF changes in aging. However, a slight increase was observed in participants aged 70 years or older. (2) Females in their 30s and 40s showed obviously lower frequencies than those in their 20s. Across all age groups, including the 80s, SFF tended to decrease markedly in association with aging. (3) The degree of SFF change in association with aging was much larger in females than in males. In addition, reference intervals (mean +/- 1.96 SD) obtained for males and females in each age group are considered useful for clinical detection of abnormalities of SFF, as well as for detection of laryngeal diseases causing SFF abnormality.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine time trends for primary treatment modalities in advanced laryngeal cancer, overall survival (OS), and laryngectomy-free interval (LFI) over the last 2 decades in The Netherlands. METHODS: We conducted an analysis of T3 to T4 laryngeal cancer data from 2 combined national (population-based and pathology-based) cancer registries. RESULTS: A total of 2072 T3 cases (14.7{\%}) and 1722 T4 cases (12.2{\%}) were identified. Total laryngectomy as primary treatment modality decreased, whereas radiotherapy (RT) increased. For T3 disease, 5-year OS after primary total laryngectomy (+/- adjuvant RT), RT, and chemoradiotherapy (CRT) was 49{\%}, 47{\%}, and 45{\%}, respectively. For T4 disease, this was 48{\%}, 34{\%}, and 42{\%} (overall p {\textless} .0001), respectively. Five-year LFI for T3 disease was 81{\%} (RT) and 77{\%} (CRT), and for T4 disease it was 81{\%} and 87{\%}, respectively. CONCLUSION: From 1991 to 2010 total laryngectomy as primary treatment modality for advanced laryngeal cancer decreased and RT increased. T3 disease showed similar survival rates for all primary treatment modalities. For T4 disease, total laryngectomy (+ adjuvant RT) showed the best survival.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE The most widely used surgical interventions for pediatric unilateral vocal cord paralysis include injection laryngoplasty, thyroplasty, and laryngeal reinnervation. Despite increasing interest in surgical interventions for unilateral vocal cord paralysis in children, the surgical outcomes data in children are scarce. OBJECTIVE To appraise and summarize the available evidence for pediatric unilateral vocal cord paralysis surgical strategies. EVIDENCE REVIEW MEDLINE (1946-2014) and EMBASE (1980-2014) were searched for publications that described the results of laryngoplasty, thyroplasty, or laryngeal reinnervation for pediatric unilateral vocal cord paralysis. Further studies were identified from bibliographies of relevant studies, gray literature, and annual scientific assemblies. Two reviewers independently appraised the selected studies for quality, level of evidence, and risk of bias as well as extracted data, including unilateral vocal cord paralysis origin, voice outcomes, swallowing outcomes, and adverse events. FINDINGS Of 366 identified studies, the inclusion criteria were met by 15 studies: 6 observational studies, 6 case series, and 3 case reports. All 36 children undergoing laryngeal reinnervation (8 studies) had improvement or resolution of dysphonia. Of 31 children receiving injection laryngoplasty (6 studies), most experienced improvement in voice quality, speech, swallowing, aspiration, and glottic closure. Of 12 children treated by thyroplasty (5 studies), 2 experienced resolution of dysphonia, 4 had some improvement, and 4 had no improvement (2 patients had undocumented outcomes). Thyroplasty resolved or improved aspiration in 7 of 8 patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Published studies suggest that reinnervation may be the most effective surgical intervention for children with dysphonia; however, long-term follow-up data are lacking. With the exception of polytetrafluoroethylene injections, injection laryngoplasty was reported to be a relatively safe, nonpermanent, and effective option for most children with dysphonia. Thyroplasty appears to have fallen out favor in recent years because of difficulty in performing this procedure in children under local anesthesia, but it continues to be a viable option for children with aspiration.},

abstract = {In order to minimize neurological symptoms and treatment-related side-effects, patients with primary or secondary brain tumors receive dexamethasone. The goal of this study was to analyze dosage and duration of dexamethasone intake and to compare the advantages and disadvantages of this medication during the course of radiation therapy (RT). Data from 138 consecutive patients were therefore analyzed retrospectively. During the course of therapy, the dosage of dexamethasone was evaluated, as were the indications for and duration of this treatment, its side-effects and any clinical changes reported during dexamethasone intake. The dosage of dexamethasone was higher at the outset and during RT (median 7-12 mg/day) than at the end of RT (median 1-6 mg/day). The average duration of dexamethasone intake was 23 weeks for patients with primary, and 7 weeks for patients with secondary brain tumors. The most frequent side-effects were a rise in serum glucose level, peripheral edema, psychiatric disorders, and Cushing's syndrome. Life-threatening complications remained rare. Initially, dexamethasone led to good clinical improvement with few side-effects of RT, whereas by the end of RT the symptom relief was slight and toxicity increased. In a group of 13 patients who received no dexamethasone during RT, 12 showed neither RT-related side-effects nor of neurological impairment. Dexamethasone effectively minimizes neurological symptoms and RT-related side-effects in patients with primary and secondary brain tumors. Nevertheless, the side-effects of dexamethasone itself increase over time. For this reason, a generalized dose scheme should not be used. Instead, dosage should be adapted to each patient's individual needs. Future prospective studies will have to determine whether dexamethasone is advantageous on balance or not.},

REVIEW SUMMARY: Different pathophysiological mechanisms are responsible for the formation of cytotoxic and vasogenic edema. Yet, these 2 types of edema often coexist and their treatment tends to overlap, with the exception of corticosteroids, which should be only used to ameliorate vasogenic edema. Currently available to control brain swelling include osmotic agents (with emphasis on mannitol and hypertonic saline solutions), corticosteroids, hyperventilation, sedation (propofol, barbiturates), neuromuscular paralysis, hypothermia, and surgical interventions. This article discusses the indications, advantages, and limitations of each treatment modality following an evidence-based approach. CONCLUSIONS: The therapy for brain edema remains largely empirical. More research aimed at enhancing our understanding of the pathophysiology of cerebral edema is needed to identify new and more effective forms of treatment.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: Serum sodium (Na) concentrations have been suggested as a useful predictor of mortality in patients with end-stage liver disease awaiting liver transplantation. Methods: We evaluated methods to incorporate Na into model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), using a prospective, multicenter database specifically created for validation and refinement of MELD. Adult, primary liver transplant candidates with end-stage liver disease were enrolled. Results: Complete data were available in 753 patients, in whom the median MELD score was 10.8 and sodium was 137 mEq/L. Low Na ({\textless}130 mEq/L) was present in 8{\%} of patients, of whom 90{\%} had ascites. During the study period, 67 patients (9{\%}) died, 243 (32{\%}) underwent transplantation, 73 (10{\%}) were withdrawn, and 370 were still waiting. MELD score and Na, at listing, were significant (both, P {\textless} .01) predictors of death within 6 months. After adjustment for MELD score and center, there was a linear increase in the risk of death as Na decreased between 135 and 120 mEq/L. A new score to incorporate Na into MELD was developed: "MELD-Na" = MELD + 1.59 (135 - Na) with maximum and minimum Na of 135 and 120 mEq/L, respectively. In this cohort, "MELD-Na" scores of 20, 30, and 40 were associated with 6{\%}, 16{\%}, and 37{\%} of risk of death within 6 months of listing, respectively. If this new score were used to allocate grafts, it would affect 27{\%} of the transplant recipients. Conclusions: We demonstrate an evidence-based method to incorporate Na into MELD, which provides more accurate survival prediction than MELD alone. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Gastroenterological Association Institute.},

Competing risks models associated frailty with waitlist mortality (death/delisting for being too sick for liver transplant). Two hundred ninety-four listed liver transplant patients with MELD ≥ 12, median age 60 years and MELD 15 were followed for 12 months. By Fried Frailty score ≥3, 17{\%} were frail; 11/51 (22{\%}) of the frail versus 25/243 (10{\%}) of the not frail died/were delisted (p = 0.03).

MELD score, pretransplant septic shock, cardiac risk, and comorbidities were independent predictors of futile outcome. Using all 4 factors, the futility risk model had a good discriminatory ability (c-statistic 0.75).

Educational level, tobacco smoking, and alcohol consumption were included in all regression models. Stratified analyses by HNC subsites were performed. This project included 17,666 cases and 28,198 controls. We found an inverse association between height and HNC (adjusted OR per 10 cm height = 0.91; 95{\%} CI 5 0.86-0.95 for men; adjusted OR = 0.86; 95{\%} CI 5 0.79-0.93 for women). In men, the estimated OR did vary by educational level, smoking status, geographic area, and control source. No differences by subsites were detected. Adult height is inversely associated with HNC risk. As height can be considered a marker of childhood illness and low energy intake, the inverse association is consistent with prior studies showing that HNC occur more frequently among deprived individuals. Further studies designed to elucidate the mechanism of such association would be warranted.},

Based on the collection of information of patients with laryngeal carcinoma regarding clinical characteristics (age, TNM stage, with or without laryngeal preservation and/or neck dissection, with or without postoperative irradiation and/or chemotherapy, etc.), QOV using Voice Handicap Index (VIH) scale and HRQOL using EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTCQLQ-H{\&}N35 scales, the differences of postsurgical HRQOL related to their clinical characteristics were analyzed using univariate nonparametric tests, the main factors impacting the postsurgical HRQOL were analyzed using regression analyses (generalized linear models) and the correlation between QOV and HRQOL analyzed using spearman correlation analysis. A total of 92 patients were enrolled in this study, on whom the use of EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-H{\&}N35 and VHI scales revealed that: the differences of HRQOL were significant among patients with different ages, TNM stages, and treatment modalities; the main factors impacting the postsurgical HRQOL were pain, speech disorder, and dry mouth; and QOV was significantly correlated with HRQOL. For the patients with laryngeal carcinoma included in our study, the quality of life after open surgeries were impacted by many factors predominated by pain, speech disorder, and dry mouth. It is suggested that doctors in China do more efforts on the patients' postoperative pain and xerostomia management and speech rehabilitation with the hope of improving the patients' quality of life.},

abstract = {Pharyngocutaneous fistula is the most common complication after total laryngectomy. The aim of the study was to establish the incidence of this complication in our series and analyse the predisposing factors. This is a retrospective study comprising 55 patients who underwent total laryngectomy. The following aspects were considered: sex, age, tumour site, pathologic staging according to TNM, performance and type of neck dissection, previous radiation therapy, previous tracheotomy, Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for comorbidity analysis, the use of stapler for pharyngeal closure, and peri-operative blood transfusion. In the cases of pharyngocutaneous fistula, we considered the post-operative period in which it was diagnosed, duration, period of hospitalization, as well as therapeutic approach and the eventual result of this treatment. Pharyngocutaneous fistula was diagnosed in 7 patients (12.7{\%}). There were no statistically significant associations between fistula development and sex (p = 1.000), previous radiation therapy (p = 0.354), stapler closure (p = 0.577), comorbidity (p = 1.000) or tumour site (p = 0.926). Patients previously submitted to tracheotomy presented higher fistula incidence (60{\%}), compared to those that had not undergone this procedure (8{\%}) (p = 0.012). Elderly patients ({\textgreater}60 years) were also more predisposed to fistula development (p = 0.051). Although without statistical significance, fistula development was also associated with peri-operative blood transfusion, T stage, and type of neck dissection.},

abstract = {"Given the tensions and demands of medicine, highly successful physicians and surgeons rarely achieve equal success as prose writers. It is truly extraordinary that a major, international pioneer in the controversial field of transplant surgery should have written a spellbinding, and heart-wrenching, autobiography." "Thomas Starzl grew up in LeMars, Iowa, the son of a newspaper publisher and a nurse. His father also wrote science fiction and was acquainted with the writer Ray Bradbury. Starzl left the family business to enter Northwestern University Medical School where he earned both an M.D. and a Ph.D. While he was a student, and later during his surgical internship at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, he began the series of animal experiments that led eventually to the world's first transplantation of the human liver in 1963." "Until the age of thirty-three, Starzl says, "I felt like a missile looking for a trajectory." His work with liver transplantation gave him a course for life and, despite initial setbacks and failures, he has pursued it relentlessly, eventually achieving stunning success." "Throughout his career, first at the University of Colorado and then at the University of Pittsburgh, he has aroused both worldwide admiration and controversy. His technical innovations and medical genius have revolutionized the field, but Starzl has not hesitated to address the moral and ethical issues raised by transplantation. In this book he clearly states his position on many hotly debated issues including brain death, randomized trials for experimental drugs, the costs of transplant operations, and the system for selecting organ recipients from among scores of desperately ill patients." "There are many heroes in the story of transplantation, and many "puzzle people," the patients who, as one journalist suggested, might one day be made entirely of various transplanted parts. They are old and young, obscure and world famous. Some have been taken into the hearts of America, like Stormie Jones, the brave and beautiful child from Texas. Every patient who receives someone else's organ - and Starzl remembers each one - is a puzzle. "It was not just the acquisition of a new part," he writes. "The rest of the body had to change in many ways before the gift could be accepted. It was necessary for the mind to see the world in a different way." The surgeons and physicians who pioneered transplantation were also changed: they too became puzzle people. "Some were corroded or destroyed by the experience, some were sublimated, and none remained the same.""},

Clinically, facial nerve function is assessed using the House-Brackmann grading scale, which also allows physicians to track the progress of a patient's facial nerve recovery. Because the facial nerve is a peripheral nerve, it has the ability to regenerate, and the extent of its functional recovery depends largely on the location and nature of its injury. In this report, the authors first describe the facial nerve anatomy, the House-Brackmann grading system, and factors known to be predictors of postoperative facial nerve outcome. The mechanisms and pathophysiology of facial nerve injury during VS surgery are then discussed, as well as factors affecting facial nerve regeneration after surgery.},

In this ongoing prospective study, we analyzed longer-term outcome data on HCC down-staging in a larger cohort of 61 patients with tumor stage exceeding T2 criteria who were enrolled between June 2002 and January 2007. Eligibility criteria for down-staging included: (1) one lesion {\textgreater}5 cm and up to 8 cm, (2) two to three lesions with at least one lesion {\textgreater}3 cm and not exceeding 5 cm, with total tumor diameter up to 8 cm; or (3) four to five lesions with none {\textgreater}3 cm, with total tumor diameter up to 8 cm. A minimum observation period of 3 months after down-staging was required before OLT. Tumor down-staging was successful in 43 patients (70.5{\%}). Thirty-five patients (57.4{\%}) had received OLT, including two who had undergone live-donor liver transplantation. Treatment failure was observed in 18 patients (29.5{\%}), primarily due to tumor progression. In the explant of 35 patients who underwent OLT, 13 had complete tumor necrosis, 17 met T2 criteria, and five exceeded T2 criteria. The Kaplan-Meier intention-to-treat survival at I and 4 years afier down-staging were 87.5{\%} and 69.3{\%}, respectively. The 1-year and 4-year posttransplantation survival rates were 96.2{\%} and 92.1{\%}, respectively. No patient had HCC recurrence afier a median postmansplantation follow-up of 25 months. The only fitctor predicting treatment failure was pretreatment alpha-fetoprotein {\textgreater}1,000 ng/mL. Conclusion: Successful down-staging of HCC can be achieved in the majority of carefully selected patients and is associated with excellent posttransplantation outcomes.

Current objective assessment methods (e.g. acoustical analysis) do not correlate well with patient symptoms. Existing subjective measures are based on clinical impression. To date, no measure has been based on the patient's experience and the aim of this study was to explore the difficulties that patients encounter as a consequence of their illness or disability. One hundred and thirty-three dysphonic patients completed an open-ended questionnaire where they were asked to make a list of the problems they experienced due to their voice disorder. Responses were categorized using the WHO International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities and Handicaps. A total number of 467 problems were listed: 60{\%} impairments, 26{\%} disabilities and 14{\%} were handicap related. The six major impairments related to altered voice and throat symptoms. Although the majority of disabilities resulted from lack of projection and clarity, the most frequently reported was singing. Reported handicaps encompassed psychological, emotional and employment-related difficulties and effects on family and friends. People with dysphonia experience social, lifestyle and employment difficulties as a consequence of their voice disorder. Responses to the open-ended questionnaire have considerable practical applications in targeting more comprehensive treatment strategies.},

Risk factors for fistula formation were analyzed, including primary treatment modality, comorbidities, and operative details, which included use of a free flap for closure, concurrent neck dissections, margin status, and preoperative tracheostomy. The length of time until leak, postoperative swallow study results, and fistula management strategies were also assessed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Fifty-five patients developed a pharyngocutaneous fistula (overall incidence, 21{\%}) in a median time of 12 days (range, 4-105 days). Twenty of these patients underwent laryngectomy as their initial treatment modality, and 35 had failed previous radiotherapy. Fistula formation was significantly higher in salvage surgery patients (P = .03), particularly those with hypothyroidism (P {\textless} .0002). A barium swallow performed at approximately 1 week after laryngectomy demonstrated a sensitivity of 26{\%} with a specificity of 94{\%}. Sixty-two percent of the fistulas healed with conservative measures only.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our data confirmed that previous radiotherapy and hypothyroidism, particularly in salvage laryngectomy patients, are important significant predictors of postoperative pharyngocutaneous fistula. The use of a postoperative barium swallow in these patients may be useful but was not found to be highly sensitive in predicting who will develop a clinically evident leak and should be used with caution.},

If patients exhibit severe symptoms consistent with increased intracranial pressure, it is recommended that higher doses such as 16 mg/day or more be considered. Choice of Steroid Level 3 If corticosteroids are given, dexamethasone is the best drug choice given the available evidence. Duration of Corticosteroid Administration Level 3 Corticosteroids, if given, should be tapered slowly over a 2 week time period, or longer in symptomatic patients, based upon an individualized treatment regimen and a full understanding of the long-term sequelae of corticosteroid therapy. Given the very limited number of studies (two) which met the eligibility criteria for the systematic review, these are the only recommendations that can be offered based on this methodology.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. Purpose of review The most difficult, and perhaps, most important decision that a clinician makes for a patient on the liver transplant wait-list is when 'not' to proceed with liver transplant. Although an individual may be suitable for transplant surgery at listing, he/she may become too sick while waiting. Recent findings This article reviews four specific conditions that commonly arise on the wait-list that may render a candidate too sick for transplant: advancing age, sarcopenia, acute on chronic liver failure, and nonliver-related medical comorbidities. Each condition, per se, is often not a criterion for delisting; the challenge arises when conditions exist in combination - how does one 'sum' up these conditions to quantify risk? Physical frailty, conceptually, represents the conditions in a candidate that are unlikely to reverse after liver function returns, or will take so long to reverse that the patient will be highly vulnerable to postoperative complications. Pretransplant assessments of physical frailty, which are objective, easily administered, and repeated in the clinical setting, enable us to measure the extent to which these factors, in isolation or combination, will reduce both quantity and quality of life after liver transplant. Summary In this article, I introduce a framework that incorporates objective pretransplant assessments of physical frailty to facilitate the decision regarding when a patient is too sick for transplant.},

abstract = {Primary prosthetic voice restoration by performing tracheoesophageal puncture (TEP) and immediate insertion of a voice prosthesis at the time of total laryngectomy (TLE) is presently the method of choice. This enables the easiest and most comfortable voice rehabilitation with the patient still under general anesthesia when the first prosthesis is inserted. Reconstruction of the pharynx with e.g. free revascularized or pedicled flaps does not preclude surgical prosthetic voice restoration. The TEP can even be done as a primary procedure after total laryngectomy and total pharyngectomy when the full circumference of the neopharynx has to be reconstructed, provided the esophagus is still present at the level of the trachea. Since indwelling devices may have a more robust construction, their device-life generally is longer than that of their non-indwelling counterparts. Indwelling devices have the unique advantage in that patient's dexterity plays a lesser role in the daily maintenance of the device. With a few refinements in the surgery of TLE several postlaryngectomy problems can be avoided or diminished such as hypertonicity of the pharyngoesophageal (PE) segment and a poor contour of the stoma. The combination of Heat and Moisture Exchanger (HME) and indwelling voice prosthesis contributes to a significant improvement of both pulmonary function and voice quality. The solution of the majority of prosthesis and TE-fistula related problems by the well trained physician, make prosthetic voice restoration a safe procedure.},

Review and reference cross-checking were performed using a priori selection criteria. Study data were abstracted and publication quality categorized independently by 2 authors. Corresponding authors were contacted to maximize data for analysis. Meta-analysis was performed only with studies that included both treatment modalities, to reduce heterogeneity and maximize rigor; random effects modeling was used to pool results.Results Eighteen publications were identified that reported VHI data following surgery and radiotherapy for T1 glottic carcinoma. No studies were randomized. When studies that reported multiple T-stages or systematic treatment selection bias were excluded, 8 retrospective cohort studies describing 362 patients were suitable for meta-analysis. Follow-up time (mean, 47 months; range, 1-298 mo) and extent of surgical excision varied across studies. Six studies showed no VHI difference between treatment arms; 2 favored radiotherapy over surgery (1 of which reported transmuscular cordectomy for all surgical patients); and none favored surgery. Meta-analysis showed no significant difference in posttreatment VHI between radiotherapy and surgery (mean difference, –5.52; 95{\%} confidence interval, –11.40, 0.36; heterogeneity I$\backslash$n2 = 61{\%}, P = .01).Conclusion VHI scores were comparable following transoral laser microsurgery and radiation therapy for T1 glottic carcinoma in the current literature, suggesting no clinically significant difference in functional voice outcomes between treatment types.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Acta Oto-Laryngologica AB (Ltd) Objectives: To determine the efficacy of delayed transmastoid facial nerve decompression in patients with Ramsay Hunt Syndrome (RHS) presenting with complete facial paralysis. Methods: Twenty-five RHS patients with complete facial nerve paralysis presenting electroneuronographic (ENoG) degeneration ≥90{\%} underwent transmastoid facial nerve decompression more than 3 weeks after the onset of paralysis. The principal features measured were 12 months pre- and post-operative House-Brackmann (HB) grades and the presence of a direct intraoperative neural response (INR) prior to decompression procedure. Correlations between these parameters, and the time between symptom onset and surgery (within or later than 30 and 50 d) were statistically analyzed. Results: Of the 25 patients 13 (52{\%}) exhibited good recovery (HB grade I or II) at 12 months-post-operatively. The timing of decompression generally did not significantly influence outcome but patients treated within 50 d of symptom onset enjoyed better outcomes than those treated later (p = .047). The presence of an INR significantly influenced outcomes (p = .0003). Conclusions: The success of delayed transmastoid facial nerve decompression in RHS patients was not affected between 25–30 and 30–40 d from symptom onset but was compromised when the delay was  {\textgreater} 50 d. The presence or absence of an INR was a good predictor of post-operative prognosis.},

abstract = {Arytenoid subluxation is a well-known cause of hoarseness due to incomplete glottic closure with intact inferior laryngeal nerves after severe laryngeal trauma. We report the case of a young man presenting after laryngeal blunt trauma with hoarseness, easy fatigue during phonation, marked difficulty with his high-pitch and singing voice and decreased phonation time, but intact function of both inferior laryngeal nerves, intact endolaryngeal mucosa sensibility and normal CT scans of the larynx and the neck. Due to the asymmetric anteromedial position of the right arytenoid with incomplete glottic closure, the primary diagnosis was arytenoid subluxation, and the patient was referred for instantaneous relocation therapy. The stroboscopic and electromyographic diagnosis of a unilateral paresis of the external branch of the right superior laryngeal nerve caused the therapy to be changed. Without repositioning, the patient had a total recovery of voice quality when the paresis receded 2 months later. In conclusion, the unilateral paresis of the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve after laryngeal blunt trauma is reported here for the first time. Although the clinical findings are familiar sequelae of thyroid surgery, they may be misdiagnosed as arytenoid subluxation after laryngeal blunt trauma. Stroboscopy and electromyography permitted the correct diagnosis.},

abstract = {Summary: Objectives. To study the details of clinical profile and management of laryngocele at a tertiary care teaching hospital of eastern India. Study Design. A prospective study. Case series of six patients of laryngocele. Methods. Six patients of laryngocele were examined at the Outpatient Department of ENT of Institute of Medical Sciences {\&} SUM Hospital, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India, between August 2010 and January 2014. The details of the patients, such as age, gender, occupations, clinical presentations, imaging modalities and treatment options, are discussed. Results. The common clinical presentations of laryngocele are hoarseness of voice and swelling in the neck. Some- times, laryngocele patients are asymptomatic. The patients were in the range of 45–70 years old, among them five were males and one was female. The diagnosis was made clinically and radiologically. Among the six patients, five were treated by surgical approach. Conclusions. Laryngocele is an abnormal dilatation of the laryngeal saccule. It is a very rare clinical condition. Hoarseness of voice and swelling in the neck are common clinical presentations in laryngocele. Imaging studies are essential for making diagnosis, determining the type, localization, extent of laryngocele and for treatment. Surgery is the treatment of choice in laryngocele.},

abstract = {A typical fractionated radiotherapy (RT) course is a long and arduous process, demanding significant financial, physical, and mental commitments from patients. Each additional session of RT significantly increases the physical and psychological burden on patients and leads to higher radiation exposure in organs-at-risk (OAR), while, in some cases, the therapeutic benefits might not be high enough to justify the risks. Today, through technological advancements in molecular biology, imaging, and genetics more information is gathered about individual patient response before, during, and after the treatment. we highlight some of the ways that mathematical tools can help assess treatment efficacy on the fly, adapt the treatment plan based on individual biological response, and optimally stop the treatment, if necessary. We term this “Optimal Stopping in RT (OSRT)”, after a similar concept in the fields of dynamic programming and Markov decision processes. In short, OSRT can dynamically determine “whether, when and how” to stop the treatment to improve therapeutic ratios.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In children, the cricoid is considered the narrowest portion of the "funnel-shaped" airway. Growth and development lead to a transition to the more cylindrical adult airway. A number of airway decisions in pediatric airway practice are based on this transition from the pediatric to the adult airway. Our primary aim in this study was to measure airway dimensions in children of various ages. The measures of the glottis and cricoid regions were used to determine whether a transition from the funnel-shaped pediatric airway to the cylindrical adult airway could be identified based on images obtained from video bronchoscopy. METHODS: One hundred thirty-five children (ASA physical status 1 or 2) aged 6 mo to 13 yr were enrolled for measurement of laryngeal dimensions, including cross-sectional area (G-CSA), anteroposterior and transverse diameters at the level of the glottis and the cricoid (C-CSA), using the video bronchoscopic technique under general anesthesia. RESULTS: Of the 135 children enrolled in the study, seven patients were excluded from the analysis mainly because of poor image quality. Of the 128 children studied (79 boys and 49 girls), mean values (+/-standard deviation) for the demographic data were age 5.9 (+/-3.3) yr, height 113.5 (+/-22.2) cm and weight 23.5 (+/-13) kg. Overall, the mean C-CSA was larger than the G-CSA (48.9 +/- 15.5 mm(2) vs 30 +/- 16.5 mm(2), respectively). This relationship was maintained throughout the study population starting from 6 mo of age (P {\textless} 0.001, r = 0.45, power = 1). The mean ratio for C-CSA: G-CSA was 2.1 +/- 1.2. There was a positive correlation between G- and the C-CSA versus age (r = 0.36, P {\textless} 0.001; r = 0.27, P = 0.001, respectively), height (r = 0.34, P {\textless} 0.001; r = 0.29, P {\textless} 0.001, respectively), and weight (r = 0.35, P {\textless} 0.001; r = 0.25, P = 0.003, respectively). No significant gender differences in the mean values of the studied variables were observed. CONCLUSION: In this study of infants and children, the glottis rather than cricoid was the narrowest portion of the pediatric airway. Similar to adults, the pediatric airway is more cylindrical than funnel shaped based on these video bronchoscopic images. Further studies are needed to determine whether these static airway measurements in anesthetized and paralyzed children reflect the dynamic characteristics of the glottis and cricoid in children.},

abstract = {The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) allocation system for liver transplantation provides "exceptions" for diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It was the aim of this study to assess equipoise between exception candidates and nonexception candidates on the waiting list and to assess if the exception system contributes to steadily increasing regional MELD at transplant. In all, 78,595 adult liver transplant candidates between January 2005 and December 2012 were analyzed. Yearly trends in waiting list characteristics and transplantation rates were analyzed for statistical association with MELD exceptions. Regional variations in these associations and the effect of exceptions on regional MELD scores at transplant were also analyzed. 27.29{\%} of the waiting list was occupied by candidates with exceptions. Candidates with exceptions fared much better on the waiting list compared to those without exceptions in mean days waiting (HCC 237 versus non-HCC 426), transplantation rates (HCC 79.05{\%} versus non-HCC 40.60{\%}), and waiting list death rates (HCC 4.49{\%} versus non-HCC 24.63{\%}). Strong regional variation in exception use occurred but exceptions were highly correlated with waiting list death rates, transplantation rates, and MELD score at removal in all regions. In a multivariate model predicting MELD score at transplant within regions, the percentage of HCC MELD exceptions was the strongest independent predictor of regional MELD score at transplant. Conclusion: Liver transplant candidates with MELD exceptions have superior outcomes compared to nonexception candidates and the current MELD exception system is largely responsible for steadily increasing MELD scores at transplant independent of geography.},

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is an excellent indication for liver transplantation, with outcomes at least as good as for other indications. ALD remains a controversial indication for liver trans- plantation. There is no robust evidence that public disquiet over distribution of donor livers to those with ALD (even if they return to alcohol) greatly affects organ donation, although this does not mean there is no consequence of such disquiet. Numerous surveys of the general public, patients, and health care professionals indicate the these patients are thought to have lower priority for access to available liver grafts. Public education is required to demonstrate that pa- tients with ALD are carefully selected for liver trans- plantation and available grafts are used with attention to equity, justice, and utility},

abstract = {In traditional Kaplan-Meier or Cox regression analysis, usually a risk factor measured at baseline is related to mortality thereafter. During follow-up, however, things may change: either the effect of a fixed baseline risk factor may vary over time, resulting in a weakening or strengthening of associations over time, or the risk factor itself may vary over time. In this paper, short-term versus long-term effects (so-called time-dependent effects) of a fixed baseline risk factor are addressed. An example is presented showing that underweight is a strong risk factor for mortality in dialysis patients, especially in the short run. In contrast, overweight is a risk factor for mortality, which is stronger in the long run than in the short run. In addition, the analysis of how time-varying risk factors (so-called time-dependent risk factors) are related to mortality is demonstrated by paying attention to the pitfall of adjusting for sequelae. The proper analysis of effects over time should be driven by a clear research question. Both kinds of research questions, that is those of time-dependent effects as well those of time-dependent risk factors, can be analyzed with time-dependent Cox regression analysis. It will be shown that using time-dependent risk factors usually implies focusing on short-term effects only.},

abstract = {Many measures of prediction accuracy have been developed. However, the most popular ones in typical medical outcome prediction settings require additional investigation of calibration. We show how rescaling the Brier score produces a measure that combines discrimination and calibration in one value and improves interpretability by adjusting for a benchmark model. We have called this measure the index of prediction accuracy (IPA). The IPA permits a common interpretation across binary, time to event, and competing risk outcomes. We illustrate this measure using example datasets. The IPA is simple to compute, and example code is provided. The values of the IPA appear very interpretable. IPA should be a prominent measure reported in studies of medical prediction model performance. However, IPA is only a measure of average performance and, by default, does not measure the utility of a medical decision.},

abstract = {Although perceptual assessment is included in most protocols for evaluating pathologic voices, a standard set of valid scales for measuring voice quality has never been established. Standardization is important for theory and for clinical acceptance, and also because validation of objective measures of voice depends on valid perceptual measures. The present study used large sets (n = 80) of male and female voices, representing a broad range of diagnoses and vocal severities. Eight experts judged the dissimilarity of each pair of voices, and responses were analyzed using nonmetric individual differences multidimensional scaling. Results indicate that differences between listeners in perceptual strategy are so great that the fundamental assumption of a common perceptual space must be questioned. Because standardization depends on the assumption that listeners are similar, it is concluded that efforts to standardize perceptual labels for voice quality are unlikely to succeed. However, analysis by synthesis may provide an alternate means of modeling quality as a function of both voices and listeners, thus avoiding this problem.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the accuracy of United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) or Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data among patients listed for liver transplantation. Of particular importance for transplant policy and practice is whether patients' outcomes are coded properly. METHODS: Using data from four transplant centers, we identified all liver transplant candidates removed from the waitlist from February 27, 2002 to July 24, 2010, with a specific focus the removal code of "other." RESULTS: Among nontransplanted patients at these centers, 2206 patients were removed for death or clinical deterioration. Of these, 8.6{\%} (189 of 2206) were misclassified; they were assigned the UNOS removal code of "other." Among these 189 misclassified patients, 128 became medically unsuitable, 35 died, and 26 became too sick to transplant. Nearly one-half (46.8{\%}) of misclassified patients were removed due to advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Among true waitlist removals for death, only 35 of 1593 (2.2{\%}) were misclassified. Conversely, of true removals for clinical deterioration, 154 of 612 (25.2{\%}) were misclassified, with significant (P {\textless} 0.001) center variation: 4.4{\%} (Baylor), 8.0{\%} (Georgetown), 32.6{\%} (University of Pennsylvania), and 45.0{\%} (Mount Sinai). Extrapolating these data to the entire United States, if "other" patients who truly died or clinically deteriorated were recoded appropriately, there would be an additional 2525 (95{\%} confidence interval, 2046-3102) patients removed from the waitlist due to death (331) or clinical deterioration (2194) since 2002. DISCUSSION: A substantial proportion of patients truly removed from the waitlist for death or clinical deterioration were misclassified as "other." Thus, analyses using the UNOS or the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database may underestimate the true proportion of patients removed from the waitlist for clinical deterioration.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES In many countries including the United Kingdom, hearing aids are a first line of audiologic intervention for many people with tinnitus and aidable hearing loss. Nevertheless, there is a lack of high quality evidence to support that they are of benefit for tinnitus, and wide variability in their use in clinical practice especially for people with mild hearing loss. The aim of this study was to identify a consensus among a sample of UK clinicians on the criteria for hearing aid candidature and clinical practice in fitting hearing aids specifically for mild hearing loss with and without tinnitus. This will allow professionals to establish clinical benchmarks and to gauge their practice with that used elsewhere. DESIGN The Delphi technique, a systematic methodology that seeks consensus amongst experts through consultation using a series of iterative questionnaires, was used. A three-round Delphi survey explored clinical consensus among a panel of 29 UK hearing professionals. The authors measured panel agreement on 115 statements covering: (i) general factors affecting the decision to fit hearing aids, (ii) protocol-driven factors affecting the decision to fit hearing aids, (iii) general practice, and (iv) clinical observations. Consensus was defined as a priori ≥70{\%} agreement across the panel. RESULTS Consensus was reached for 58 of the 115 statements. The broad areas of consensus were around factors important to consider when fitting hearing aids; hearing aid technology/features offered; and important clinical assessment to verify hearing aid fit (agreement of 70{\%} or more). For patients with mild hearing loss, the greatest priority was given by clinicians to patient-centered criteria for fitting hearing aids: hearing difficulties, motivation to wear hearing aids, and impact of hearing loss on quality of life (chosen as top five by at least 64{\%} of panelists). Objective measures were given a lower priority: degree of hearing loss and shape of the audiogram (chosen as top five by less than half of panelists). Areas where consensus was not reached were related to the use of questionnaires to predict and verify hearing aid benefit for both hearing and tinnitus; audiometric criteria for fitting hearing aids; and safety of using loud sounds when verifying hearing aid fitting when the patient has tinnitus (agreement of {\textless}70{\%}). CONCLUSIONS The authors identified practices that are considered important when recommending or fitting hearing aid for a patient with tinnitus. More importantly perhaps, they identified practical issues where there are divided opinions. Their findings inform the design of clinical trials and open up debate on the potential impact of practice differences on patient outcomes.},

Sixty-five varyingly dysphonic and five normal voices were recorded onto CD in random order. Thirty voices were recorded twice. Seven experienced and trained speech and language therapists rated all voices on the three scales. Only the overall grade was found to be reliable for the Buffalo Voice Profile. The reliability of the VPA scheme was found to be poor to moderate. The VPA may have a use as a multi-dimensional and in-depth evaluation of voice types, but its greater scope is at the expense of reliability.

abstract = {This article is motivated by jointly modelling longitudinal and time-to-event clinical data of patients with diabetes and end-stage renal disease. All patients are on the waiting list for the pancreas transplant after kidney transplant, and some of them have a pancreas transplant before kidney transplant failure or death. Scant literature has studied the dynamical joint relationship of the estimated glomerular filtration rates trajectory, the effect of pancreas transplant, and time-to-event outcomes, although it remains an important clinical question. In an attempt to describe the association in the multiple outcomes, we propose a new joint model with a longitudinal submodel and an accelerated failure time submodel, which are linked by some latent variables. The accelerated failure time submodel is used to determine the relationship of the time-to-event outcome with all predictors. In addition, the piecewise linear function in the survival submodel is used to calculate the dynamic hazard ratio curve of a time-dependent side event, because the effect of the side event on the time-to-event outcome is non-proportional. The model parameters are estimated with a Monte Carlo EM algorithm. The finite sample performance of the proposed method is investigated in simulation studies. Our method is demonstrated by fitting the joint model for the clinical data of 13,635 patients with diabetes and the end-stage renal disease.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Endoscopic laryngopharyngeal surgery (ELPS) is a minimally invasive transoral surgery that was developed to treat superficial larygo-pharyngeal cancer, in which a mucosal lesion is resected transorally while preserving deeper structures by subepithelial injection. The purpose of this retrospective study is to evaluate voice outcome in patients who underwent ELPS for superficial hypopharyngeal cancer. As important structures in producing voice, such as intrinsic laryngeal muscles, their fascia, and recurrent laryngeal nerve, are located in the medial side of the piriform sinus and the postcricoid region of the hypopharynx, we focused on patients with cancer lesions involving these regions. METHODS: From April 2010 to March 2011, 25 consecutive patients with superficial laryngopharyngeal cancer were treated with ELPS at Kyoto University Hospital. Among the 25 patients, 11 patients with cancer lesions on the medial side of the piriform sinus or the postcricoid area were studied. Preoperative and postoperative voice functions including maximum phonation time (MPT), mean flow rate (MFR), jitter, shimmer, soft phonation index (SPI), and noise-to-harmonic ratio (NHR), were compared retrospectively. RESULTS: Five of 11 cancer lesions had submucosal invasion and no lesion had invaded the muscular layer pathologically. T stage was classified as Tis in 5 cases, T1 in 4 cases, and T2 in 2 cases. All lesions involved the medial side of the piriform sinus and 2 also involved the postcricoid area. Vocal fold movement was normal in all cases after the surgery. Average preoperative and postoperative values for MPT, MFR, jitter, shimmer, SPI, and NHR, were 22.7 seconds and 23.4 seconds, 165 mL/sec and 150 mL/sec, 1.53{\%} and 1.77{\%}, 3.82{\%} and 5.17{\%}, 35.5 and 36.6, and 0.13{\%} and 0.14{\%}, respectively. There was no statistical difference between preoperative and postoperative data for all values examined. CONCLUSION: ELPS is useful in preserving voice function in the treatment of superficial hypopharyngeal cancer. Preserving the deeper structures including intrinsic muscles and their fascia may be important for preserving voice function as long as the lesions are superficial.},

abstract = {AIM To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on donor-to-recipient gender mismatch as a risk factor for post-transplant graft loss. METHODS A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Cochrane Library database and EMBASE. The primary outcome was graft loss after liver transplantation. Odds ratios and 95{\%} confidence intervals were calculated to compare the pooled data between groups with different donor-to-recipient gender matches. Three analyses were done considering (1) gender mismatches (F-M and M-F) vs matches (M-M and F-F); (2) Female-to-Male mismatch vs other matches; and (3) Male-to-Female mismatch vs other matches. RESULTS A total of 7 articles were analysed. Gender mismatch (M-F and F-M) was associated with a significant increase of graft loss respect to match (M-M and F-F) (OR: 1.30; 95{\%}CI: 1.13-1.50; P {\textless} 0.001). When F-M mismatch was specifically investigated, it confirmed its detrimental role in terms of graft survival (OR: 1.83; 95{\%}CI: 1.20-2.80; P = 0.005). M-F mismatch failed to present a significant role (OR: 1.09; 95{\%}CI: 0.73-1.62; P = 0.68). CONCLUSION Gender mismatch is a risk factor for poor graft survival after liver transplantation. Female-to-male mismatch represents the worst combination. More studies are needed with the intent to better clarify the reasons for these results.},

Spontaneous closure was noted in 80{\%}. Simultaneous laryngectomy and partial pharyngectomy or neck dissection increased the risk of fistula formation. Preoperative irradiation, short interval between radiotherapy and operation, and cobalt/roentgen radiation instead of photons predispose to this complication. The fistulas appeared earlier, and the sizes of fistulas were significantly larger in patients with previous irradiation than those in patients with no preoperative irradiation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Postoperative pharyngocutaneous fistulas significantly increase patients' morbidity and hospital stay. Good surgical technique and postoperative treatment should be paid attention to patients with an increased risk of pharyngocutaneous fistula formation.},

abstract = {Prediction models of post-liver transplant mortality are crucial so that donor organs are not allocated to recipients with unreasonably high probabilities of mortality. Machine learning algorithms, particularly deep neural networks (DNNs), can often achieve higher predictive performance than conventional models. In this study, we trained a DNN to predict 90-day post-transplant mortality using preoperative variables and compared the performance to that of the Survival Outcomes Following Liver Transplantation (SOFT) and Balance of Risk (BAR) scores, using United Network of Organ Sharing data on adult patients who received a deceased donor liver transplant between 2005 and 2015 (n = 57,544). The DNN was trained using 202 features, and the best DNN's architecture consisted of 5 hidden layers with 110 neurons each. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of the best DNN model was 0.703 (95{\%} CI: 0.682-0.726) as compared to 0.655 (95{\%} CI: 0.633-0.678) and 0.688 (95{\%} CI: 0.667-0.711) for the BAR score and SOFT score, respectively. In conclusion, despite the complexity of DNN, it did not achieve a significantly higher discriminative performance than the SOFT score. Future risk models will likely benefit from the inclusion of other data sources, including high-resolution clinical features for which DNNs are particularly apt to outperform conventional statistical methods.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To study and compare the outcome of trans-oral CO2 laser microsurgery for early glottic squamous cell cancer with and without the involvement of anterior commissure (AC). STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective analysis of 296 cases of early glottic squamous cancer treated by trans-oral CO2 laser microsurgery. METHODS: The patients were divided into two groups depending on whether AC was involved or not. The impact of AC involvement on rates of local recurrence, laryngeal preservation, overall survival, and disease-specific survival was compared in both the groups. RESULTS: Out of the 296 cases, 61 cases had AC involvement, while in 235 cases AC was free of disease. Local recurrence rate was significantly higher at 29.51{\%} in the group with AC involvement, while only 18.3{\%} cases had local recurrence in the group without AC involvement with P value of 0.0001. On T stage-wise analysis, 34.8{\%} cases of T2 lesions with AC involvement developed local recurrence, as compared to only 10.26{\%} cases of T2 without AC involvement with significant P value of 0.007. Larynx preservation rate was 95.8{\%} versus 93.26{\%} in the AC-involved and AC not-involved cases, respectively, without any statistical significance (P=0.287). The overall survival was 90.16{\%} versus 86.38{\%} in the cases with and without AC involvement, respectively, without significant P value 0.642. CONCLUSIONS: Trans-oral laser surgery is an excellent treatment option in patients with early glottic cancer irrespective of whether or not the AC is involved. Trans-oral laser microsurgery for early glottic cancer involving AC requires adequate exposure, proper assessment, good experience, and advanced surgical skills.},

Quality of life was measured by SF-36, Voice-Related Quality of Life (V-RQOL), and Voice Handicap Index (VHI) protocols, applied on the same day. Results: The SF-36 showed that patients who received exclusive chemoradiotherapy had better quality of life than the TES and ES groups. The V-RQOL showed that the voice-related quality of life was lower in the ES group. In the VHI, the ES group showed higher scores for overall, emotional, functional, and organic VHI. Discussion: Quality of life and voice in patients treated with chemoradiotherapy was better than in patients treated surgically.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To report on the management of laryngoceles by CO2 laser-assisted endoscopic excision. STUDY DESIGN: A 15-year retrospective study of 12 adult patients (7 men and 5 women) who presented with a laryngocele. Nine patients had an internal laryngocele, one patient had an external laryngocele, and two patients had combined internal-external components. Two laryngoceles were right-sided, six were left-sided, and four were bilateral. METHODS: An endoscopic examination of the laryngocele was carried out for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Once identified the air- or mucus-filled cyst (extending from the laryngeal ventricle into the paraglottic space and beyond the thyrohyoid membrane in some cases), the laryngocele was excised in toto, with its surrounding capsule, via endoscopic approach using the CO2 laser. RESULTS: The main presenting symptom was dysphonia in seven patients, visible or palpable mass in the neck in three, and upper airway obstruction in the remaining two. All laryngoceles were treated with endoscopic laser excision of the internal and external components when required. The average postoperative stay in hospital was 1.8 days. Only two of the patients treated had a tracheotomy; both cases presented elsewhere with an emergency airway obstruction, which necessitated tracheotomy. In these two cases, decannulation was subsequently performed. There were no significant complications. The follow-up ranged from 6 months to 5 years. CONCLUSION: CO2 laser-assisted endoscopic excision of a laryngocele is a quick, precise, and safe alternative to an external approach excision (lateral thyroidotomy, laryngofissure) with fewer complications than its external counterparts, resulting in speedier rehabilitation of both the patient and his or her voice.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of a total laryngectomy on the swallow and subsequent quality of life in head and neck cancer patients. DESIGN: Cross-sectional single centre cohort study. SETTING: Head and Neck Oncology Unit, Tertiary Referral Unit. PATIENTS: Sixty-two patients who underwent total laryngectomy at our centre participated in the study. METHODS: Subjects were stratified by age, sex, tumour stage, other procedures such as myotomy and nerve re-implantation. Pharyngectomy, glossectomy, flap reconstruction, neck dissection and previous radio- and chemotherapy were also assessed to see if they affected swallow and subsequent quality of life. Main outcome was measured using the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory questionnaire. RESULTS: Responses were received from 46 males and 16 females (response rate of 80.5{\%}) with a mean age of 64.7 years (SD 9.4). Median follow-up in patients was 90 months (range 1-276). The mean MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory total score in our series of patients was 77.7 (SD 16.6). MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory global score was 79.4 (SD 22.6), Emotional score was 77.7 (SD 17.8), Functional score 81.3 (SD 15.9) and Physical score was 74.1(SD 18). Statistically significant differences were seen between the emotional scores of glossectomised and non-glossectomised patients (Mann Whitney, P = 0.04). No significant correlation was seen between the subscale scores and the remaining treatment variables such as age, gender, site, tumour stage, myotomy, nerve implantation, radiotherapy, reconstruction and major complications. CONCLUSION: This questionnaire study is the largest of its type to assess the swallow of patients who have undergone laryngectomy at a single centre. The overall result confirmed that most patients had a subjectively good swallow. Only glossectomy and the method of PE segment closure were shown to significantly affect swallowing outcomes following surgery. We recommend further work especially prospective studies pre and post surgery using this or similarly validated instruments to fully assess swallow in the laryngectomy population.},

abstract = {The normal motion of the cricoarytenoid joint was characterized and analyzed in this study using seven fresh cadaver larynges mounted rigidly in an external fixator apparatus after radiopaque markers were attached to laryngeal landmarks. Fluoroscopic imaging and recording was performed of top, front, and side views while the arytenoid cartilages of each larynx were manipulated through the full range of motion from adduction to abduction. Computer video capture was performed of the recordings and editing of still frames accomplished to generate three-dimensional plots of cricoarytenoid joint motion, which are shown in the manuscript. Selective and varying sequential disconnection of muscular and ligamentous structures to the arytenoid cartilage was achieved to determine their contributions to cricoarytenoid joint motion limitations and stability. The vocalis ligament, cricoarytenoid ligament, and conus elasticus are most important in controlling abduction, whereas the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle and conus elasticus are crucial in limiting adduction. The vocalis ligament prevents posterior displacement of the vocal process, while the cricoarytenoid ligament and a newly described ligament, the posterior capsular ligament, restricts anterior vocal process migration. Another ligament, the anterior capsular ligament, is described, which limits backward arytenoid cartilage tilting and lateral movement of the arytenoid cartilage on the cricoid cartilage facet. Section of the vocalis ligament with underlying conus elasticus produced reducible lateral arytenoid cartilage subluxation. Confirmation of cricoarytenoid joint facet relationships in full adduction and abduction was accomplished by fixation of the cricoarytenoid joints of one larynx in the two positions with adhesive, and subsequent exposure of the joint surfaces. Review of literature detailing human laryngeal embryological development shows that the glottis and arytenoid cartilages are formed in adduction, which explains how cricoarytenoid joint ligaments collaborate to achieve accurate vocal process approximation in adduction despite side-to-side asymmetries of the cricoarytenoid joint structures in the same larynges.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Author(s). Background: The allocation of any scarce health care resource, especially a lifesaving resource, can create profound ethical and legal challenges. Liver transplant allocation currently is based upon urgency, a sickest-first approach, and does not utilize capacity to benefit. While urgency can be described reasonably well with the MELD system, benefit encompasses multiple dimensions of patients' well-being. Currently, the balance between both principles is ill-defined. Methods: This survey with 502 participants examines how urgency and benefit are weighted by different stakeholders (medical staff, patients on the liver transplant list or already transplanted, medical students and non-medical university staff and students). Results: Liver transplant patients favored the sickest-first allocation, although all other groups tended to favor benefit. Criteria of a successful transplantation were a minimum survival of at least 1 year and recovery of functional status to being ambulatory and capable of all self-care (ECOG 2). An individual delisting decision was accepted when the 1-year survival probability would fall below 50{\%}. Benefit was found to be a critical variable that may also trigger the willingness to donate organs. Conclusions: The strong interest of stakeholder for successful liver transplants is inadequately translated into current allocation rules.},

abstract = {Objective Cirrhotic patients are at high hospitalisation risk with subsequent high mortality. Current risk prediction models have varied performances with methodological room for improvement. We used current analytical techniques using automatically extractable variables from the electronic health record (EHR) to develop and validate a posthospitalisation mortality risk score for cirrhotic patients and compared performance with the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), model for end-stage liver disease with sodium (MELD-Na), and the CLIF Consortium Acute Decompensation (CLIF-C AD) models. Design We analysed a retrospective cohort of 73 976 patients comprising 247 650 hospitalisations between 2006 and 2013 at any of 123 Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals. Using 45 predictor variables, we built a time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model with all-cause mortality as the outcome. We compared performance to the three extant models and reported discrimination and calibration using bootstrapping. Furthermore, we analysed differential utility using the net reclassification index (NRI). Results The C-statistic for the final model was 0.863, representing a significant improvement over the MELD, MELD-Na, and the CLIF-C AD, which had C-statistics of 0.655, 0.675, and 0.679, respectively. Multiple risk factors were significant in our model, including variables reflecting disease severity and haemodynamic compromise. The NRI showed a 24{\%} improvement in predicting survival of low-risk patients and a 30{\%} improvement in predicting death of high-risk patients. Conclusion We developed a more accurate mortality risk prediction score using variables automatically extractable from an EHR that may be used to risk stratify patients with cirrhosis for targeted postdischarge management.},

abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cause of immediate and late medialization laryngoplasty failures and to describe their management. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed in 20 patients who underwent revision surgery after failed medialization laryngoplasty. Analysis was based on preoperative spiral CT scan, preoperative and postoperative videostrobolaryngoscopy, and phonatory function measures. Results: Three major types of failures were identified. The most common problem was arytenoid rotation with a persistent posterior glottic gap (11 of 20). Malposition or wrong size of the implants resulted in a lateralized vocal fold or false vocal fold medialization (6 of 20). Three patients had implants that were extruding. Late atrophy and bowing resulted in a glottal gap (2 of 20). One patient had fibrosis around the implant requiring removal. Spiral CT scan of the larynx located the implant precisely and showed the degree of arytenoid rotation. Patients with arytenoid rotation and posterior gap had revision medialization combined with arytenoid adduction. Revision medialization was performed in 11 patients, arytenoid adduction in 12 patients, lipoinjection in 2 patients, and 4 implants were removed. The voice was improved in 15 patients. Improved voice was correlated with improved phonation time and reduced phonatory airflow rates. Conclusion: Immediate and late failures of medialization laryngoplasty are due to several possible causes. Revision surgery is feasible and highly suecessful. To select between the surgical alternatives work up should include preoperative analysis of vocal function, videostrobolaryngoscopic analysis, and spiral CT of the larynx.},

@article{Kiss2001,
abstract = {For a long time it was believed that the nucleotide sequence of every RNA would represent a simple copy of its coding DNA. This axiom of molecular biology, however, has suffered several jolts during the last 25 years. The discovery of intervening or intronic sequences (splicing) and the finding that individual nucleotides can be inserted into and deleted from RNAs (RNA editing) demonstrated that genetic information can be changed at the RNA level. Post‐transcriptional modification of individual ribonucleotides, namely deamination of adenosines and cytidines, can also change the readout of mRNAs (reviewed by Maas and Rich, 2000). Stable cellular RNAs, such as tRNAs, rRNAs and snRNAs, have long been known to contain a large number of post‐transcriptionally synthesized irregular ribonucleotides (Limbach et al ., 1994). In tRNAs, the modified nucleotides can facilitate the formation of correct anticodon–codon interaction and thereby increase the efficiency and fidelity of translation (reviewed by Agris, 1996). In rRNAs and spliceosomal snRNAs, methylation of the ribose moiety at the 2′‐hydroxyl group and conversion of uridines into pseudouridine are the most prevalent nucleotide modifications. Since 2′‐ O ‐methylated nucleotides and pseudouridines are restricted to the functionally essential regions of rRNAs and snRNAs (Reddy et al ., 1988; Maden, 1990), they are expected to contribute to the faithful function of the ribosome and the spliceosome. Consistent with this view, lack of ribosomal pseudouridines can reduce the growth rate or confer a selective disadvantage when it is competed against wild‐type ribosomes (Raychaudhuri et al ., 1999; Wrzesinski et al ., 2000). More tellingly, nucleotide modifications in the 5′‐terminal region of the U2 spliceosomal snRNA are absolutely essential for its function in pre‐mRNA splicing (Yu et al ., 1998).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe human 18S, 5.8S and 28S rRNAs together carry ∼110 2′‐ O ‐methyl groups and almost 100 pseudouridines (Maden, 1990).

abstract = {Radiotherapy (RT) is the standard treatment for high-grade gliomas. However, toxicity may develop during RT, such as brain edema or worsening of neurological symptoms. Surprisingly, no dedicated study had focused on steroid requirements during RT in adult patients with malignant gliomas. We evaluated prospectively all patients with malignant gliomas treated by RT in a single center from July 2006 to May 2009. Age, sex, initial Karnofsky performance status (KPS), tumor localization and histology, type of surgical resection, clinical target volume, total dose and duration of RT, concomitant treatment with temozolomide, and steroid dosage during RT and at 1 and 3 months after RT were recorded in all patients. Most of the 80 patients (70{\%}) were already taking steroids before RT. Half of them (55{\%}) required initiation or further steroids increase during RT. The median time to steroid increase was 8 days. Only 13{\%} of patients remained free of steroids during RT, and the mean maximal dosage of prednisone was 55 ± 48 mg. At 3 months after RT, 29{\%} of patients were free of steroids, and the mean prednisone dosage was 32 ± 50 mg. Unresected tumors and initial KPS ≤80{\%} were the only variables associated with higher steroid requirements on multivariate analysis. In our series, almost all patients required steroids during RT. Poor initial KPS and biopsy were associated with higher steroid requirements.},

There is an urgent need for effective global actions including education, prevention and early diagnosis to manage and treat CLDs, thus preventing cirrhosis-related morbidity and mortality. Our role is to increase the awareness of the public, healthcare professionals and public health authorities to encourage active policies for early management that will decrease the short- and long-term public health burden of these diseases. Because necroinflammation is the key mechanism in the progression of CLDs, it should be detected early. Thus, large-scale screening for CLDs is needed.

abstract = {Liver transplantation has emerged as a highly efficient treatment for a variety of acute and chronic liver diseases. However, organ shortage is becoming an increasing problem globally, limiting the applicability of liver transplantation. In addition, potential recipients are becoming sicker, thereby increasing the risk of losing the graft during transplantation or in the initial postoperative period after liver transplantation (three months). This trend is challenging the model for end-stage liver disease allocation system, where the sickest candidates are prioritised and no delisting criteria are given. The weighting of the deontological demand for “equity”, trying to save every patient, regardless of the overall utility; and “efficiency”, rooted in utilitarianism, trying to save as many patients as possible and increase the overall quality of life of patients facing the same problem, has to be reconsidered. In this article we are aiming to overcome the widespread concept of futility in liver transplantation, providing a definition of potentially inappropriate liver transplantation and giving guidance on situations where it is best not to proceed with liver transplantation, to decrease the mortality rate in the first three months after transplantation. We propose “absolute” and “relative” conditions, where early post-transplant mortality is highly probable, which are not usually captured in risk scores predicting post-transplant survival. Withholding liver transplantation for listed patients in cases where liver transplant is not deemed clearly futile, but is potentially inappropriate, is a far-reaching decision. Until now, this decision had to be discussed extensively on an individual basis, applying explicit communication and conflict resolution processes, since the model for end-stage liver disease score and most international allocation systems do not include explicit delisting criteria to support a fair delisting process. More work is needed to better identify cases where transplantation is potentially inappropriate and to integrate and discuss these delisting criteria in allocation systems, following a societal debate on what we owe to all liver transplant candidates.},

Yet, most colon cancers can be prevented through the detection and removal of premalignant lesions.1 Colorectal cancer screening and polypectomy have been credited with progressive trends in decreased rate of colorectal incidence.2 The majority of benign neoplasms detected at screening colonoscopy are small and removed easily with widely employed biopsy-and-snare polypectomy techniques. However, larger flat and sessile lesions are increasingly recognized, predominantly in the proximal colon.3 Failure to identify these lesions in the past may account for disappointing rates of "missed cancers" in patients who have undergone prior colonoscopy.4 Enhancements in endoscopic image acquisition and display along with increased vigilance and improved recognition on the part of the colonoscopist have resulted in higher detection rates of these lesions. Now that we have found them, what do we do? Large, sessile, nonpedunculated lesions are associated with higher rates of high-grade dysplasia and carcinoma and pose challenges for endoscopic eradication. As such, patients with these lesions have been recommended commonly for operative resection, but that standard of practice is undergoing reevaluation and dynamic change.},

Additionally, random-effects models were used to calculate mean differences with 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS Overall, a total of 13 published studies were included in our study, with 368 patients in the RT group and 440 patients in the LS group, respectively. No significant differences in Voice Handicap Index (VHI), jitter and shimmer were found between RT and endoscopic LS among patients with Tis-T1N0M0 glottic carcinoma and T1aN0M0 laryngeal cancer. However, the acoustic voice analysis parameters of Fo values were significantly lower in RT group than that in LS group. CONCLUSION The results from this meta-analysis support that the LS has more advantages than RT in terms of voice quality. However, more studies on voice outcome need to validate our findings.},

abstract = {Because pharyngoesophageal spasm can limit successful voice restoration after total laryngectomy, 24 patients underwent a modified pharyngeal closure in an effort to avoid this problem. All patients underwent total laryngectomy with appropriate neck dissections and pharyngeal closure with a half-muscle closure technique in which only one side of the remnant constrictor muscles was used to reinforce the primary closure. Twenty-three patients underwent voice restoration. Twenty-two (96{\%}) had a functional voice, and 1 patient (4{\%}) had pharyngoesophageal spasm that required a secondary myotomy. One fistula (4{\%}) occurred and resolved with conservative measures. Quantitative voice analysis demonstrated no significant differences between half-closure patients and control patients for fundamental frequency (96 Hz versus 101 Hz) or intensity (57 dB versus 64 dB). Extensive qualitative analysis by trained and naive listeners revealed no differences. This preliminary report indicates the half-muscle closure modification of the pharyngeal closure at primary laryngectomy may provide a simple and effective means of avoiding pharyngoesophageal spasm and maintaining an effective voice without increased complications.},

abstract = {Hyponatremia is frequently seen in patients with ascites secondary to advanced cirrhosis and portal hypertension. The development of ascites in patients with cirrhosis is multi-factorial. Portal hypertension and the associated systemic vasodilation lead to activation of the sodium-retaining neurohumoral mechanisms which include the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, sympathetic nervous system and antidiuretic hormone (ADH). The net effect is the avid retention of sodium and water to compensate for the low effective circulatory volume resulting in the development of ascites. Although not apparent in the early stages of cirrhosis, the progression of cirrhosis and ascites leads to impairment of the kidneys to eliminate solute- free water. This leads to additional compensatory mechanisms including non-osmotic secretion of ADH, also known as arginine vasopressin, further worsening excess water retention and thereby hyponatremia. Hyponatremia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with cirrhosis, and is an important prognostic marker both before and after liver transplant. The management of hyponatremia in this setting is a challenge as conventional therapy for hyponatremia including fluid restriction and loop diuretics are frequently inefficacious. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiology and various treatment modalities, including selective vasopressin receptor antagonists, for the management of hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis.},

The amount of vocal cord to be surgically removed logically depends on the surface and deep extension of the neoplasm. Thus, a prerequisite for proper management includes an analysis of the voice changes after each of the progressive types of cordectomy described in the European Laryngological Society Classification. Between January 1998 and December 2000, 89 patients with glottic cancer (8 Tis, 63 T1a, 18 T1b) underwent different types of endoscopic cordectomy. Perceptual analysis (GRBAS scale); objective analyses of jitter, shimmer, and noise-to-harmonics ratio; and subjective (Voice Handicap Index) evaluation of voice were performed in 51 patients. Statistical evaluation of preoperative and postoperative objective results by analysis of covariance, as well as perceptual and subjective data, showed significant voice improvement after type I and II cordectomies, with the voice attaining nearly normal parameters. By contrast, after type III, IV, and V cordectomies, the vocal outcome was not significantly different from the preoperative pattern. It can therefore be concluded that type I and II resections, whenever indicated, are adequate procedures even for professional voice users. By contrast, accurate counseling is mandatory before type III, IV, and V cordectomies.},

abstract = {Transplant-related survival benefit is calculated as the difference between life expectancy with transplantation and life expectancy without transplantation. Determining eligibility and prioritization for liver transplantation based on the highest survival benefit is a superior strategy to prioritization based on the highest urgency (ie, the highest wait-list mortality) or the highest utility (ie, the highest posttransplant survival) because prioritization based on the highest survival benefit maximizes the overall life expectancy of all patients in need of liver transplantation. Although the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD)–based prioritization system was designed as an urgency-based system, in practice it functions to a large extent as a survival benefit–based system, when the natural MELD score is used without exceptions. Survival benefit considerations should be used to determine the consequences of deviating from prioritization based on the natural MELD score, such as when exception points are awarded to patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that are independent of MELD score or tumor burden, or the appropriateness of expanding eligibility for transplantation. The most promising application of survival benefit–based prioritization would be to replace the current system of prioritization of patients with HCC by one that uses their natural MELD score and tumor characteristics such as HCC tumor burden, serum alpha fetoprotein level, and response to locoregional therapies to predict the impact on survival benefit caused by the presence of HCC and adjust the natural MELD score for prioritization accordingly.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To test the hypothesis that subligamental cordectomy produces superior acoustic outcome than subepithelial cordectomy for early (T1-2) glottic cancer that requires complete removal of the superficial lamina propria but does not involve the vocal ligament. STUDY DESIGN: Computer simulation. METHODS: A computational tool for vocal fold surgical planning and simulation (the National Center for Voice and Speech Phonosurgery Optimizer-Simulator) was used to evaluate the acoustic output of alternative vocal fold morphologies. Four morphologies were simulated: normal, subepithelial cordectomy, subligamental cordectomy, and transligamental cordectomy (partial ligament resection). The primary outcome measure was the range of fundamental frequency (F0 ) and sound pressure level (SPL). A more restricted F0 -SPL range was considered less favorable because of reduced acoustic possibilities given the same range of driving subglottic pressure and identical vocal fold posturing. RESULTS: Subligamental cordectomy generated solutions covering an F0 -SPL range 82{\%} of normal for a rectangular vocal fold. In contrast, transligamental and subepithelial cordectomies produced significantly smaller F0 -SPL ranges, 57{\%} and 19{\%} of normal, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study illustrates the use of the Phonosurgery Optimizer-Simulator to test a specific hypothesis regarding the merits of two surgical alternatives. These simulation results provide theoretical support for vocal ligament excision with maximum muscle preservation when superficial lamina propria resection is necessary but the vocal ligament can be spared on oncological grounds. The resection of more tissue may paradoxically allow the eventual recovery of a better speaking voice, assuming glottal width is restored. Application of this conclusion to surgical practice will require confirmatory clinical data. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A.},

DESIGN Multicenter, retrospective consecutive cohort of stage 1 and 2 glottic carcinoma treated with TLM or RT. SETTING Three Canadian academic cancer centres. METHODS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The patients were those of the regional cancer registries associated with each of the participating universities between 2002 and 2010. The primary oncologic end point was organ preservation. The primary functional outcome measure was the Voice Handicap Index (VHI-10). RESULTS A total of 234 patients were treated for early glottic cancer (143 TLM, 91 RT). At 2 years, the laryngeal preservation rate for stage 1 disease was 100{\%} TLM and 92{\%} RT (p {\textless} .004); for stage 2 disease, it was 100{\%} TLM and 88{\%} RT (p = not significant). There was only one laryngectomy in the TLM group over 5 years posttreatment. There were functional data on 132 patients (83 TLM, 49 RT). Median VHI-10 scores were inferior for laser patients at all three time intervals (6, 12, and 24-48 months posttreament) despite a stage bias in favour of TLM (range of median VHI score over time intervals: TLM = 9.5-12, RT = 3.5-8; p = .01-.08). However, theses scores represent mild disability in both groups. CONCLUSIONS TLM patients have poorer voice quality than RT patients. However, the advantages of TLM in most patients outweigh the degree of voice handicap. Organ preservation rates for TLM were better than or equal to those of RT for both stage 1 and 2 glottic cancer.},

abstract = {Summary: This study examined the reliability of two methods for documenting voice quality by clinicians and compared the methods for documenting patients' perceptions of voice quality. It involved a prospective reliability study and a retrospective chart review. Reliability of two clinician-based voice assessment protocols-Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, Strain (GRBAS) and Consensus Auditory Perceptual Evaluation-Voice (CAPE-V)-was evaluated. These two protocols were then compared after use in voice assessments of 42 males and 61 females performed by a certified speech-language pathologist specializing in the assessment of voice disorders. In addition, two patient-based scales (Voice Related Quality of Life, or V-RQOL, and Iowa Patient's Voice Index, or IPVI) obtained from the same patients were compared with each other and with the clinician-based scales. Reliability of clinicians' ratings of overall severity of dysphonia using GRBAS and CAPE-V scales was very good (r {\textgreater} 0.80). Agreement between V-RQOL Total scores and IPVI ratings of the patient's perceptions of impact of dysphonia was less strong (Spearman's r = -0.76). There was relatively weak agreement between patient-based and clinician-based scales. Clinician's perceptions of dysphonia appeared to be reliable and unaffected by rating tool, as indicated by the high level of agreement between the two rating systems when they were used together. The CAPE-V system appeared to be more sensitive to small differences within and among patients than the GRBAS system. The V-RQOL and IPVI approaches to documenting patient's perceptions of dysphonia agreed less well possibly due to differences in patient dependence on voice and on interpretation of the rating tool items. The differences between clinician-based and patient-based data support the conclusion that clinicians and patients experience and consider dysphonia very differently. ?? 2007 The Voice Foundation.},

In particular, we demonstrate that several C/D box snoRNAs give rise to gene regulatory RNAs, named sno-miRNAs here. Our data are complementing the increasing number of studies in the field of small RNAs with regulatory functions. In massively deep sequencing of small RNA fractions we identified high copy numbers of sub-sequences from {\textgreater}30 snoRNAs with lengths of ≥18 nt. RNA secondary structure prediction indicated for a majority of candidates a location in predicted stem regions. Experimental analysis revealed efficient gene silencing for 11 box C/D sno-miRNAs, indicating cytoplasmic processing and recruitment to the RNA silencing machinery. Assays in four different human cell lines indicated variations in both the snoRNA levels and their processing to active sno-miRNAs. In addition we show that box D elements are predominantly flanking at least one of the sno-miRNA strands, while the box C element locates within the sequence of the sno-miRNA guide strand.},

Results: No statistical difference was found between type I/II cordectomy and RT for T1 glottic carcinoma (T1RT), whereas T1RT showed a significantly better outcome than type III cordectomy (G score: p = 0.016, maximum phonation time: p {\textless} 0.01, mean flow rate: p {\textless} 0.01). Type IV cordectomy was equivalent to RT or CRT for T2 glottic carcinoma (T2RT/CRT), while types V and VI showed a worse voice quality than T2RT/CRT (G score: p = 0.038 to type VI, B score: p = 0.025 to type V and p = 0.032 to type VI, A score: p = 0.017 to type VI). Conclusions: Voice quality after laser cordectomy differs according to the type of cordectomy. Surgeons should inform patients about the expected voice quality after each treatment modality.},

Each patient's care was overseen by the senior author (E.S.P.). The 61 patients who were seen within 48 hours of their accident are compared with those treated after 48 hours. All patients are classified by both injury (groups 1 through 5) and treatment (types I through III). Results are reported for voice, airway, and swallowing. Our methods of evaluation and treatment are outlined, and controversial aspects of patient management are addressed. We conclude that conservative treatment of group 1 and 2 injuries is 100{\%} effective, expeditious repair of laryngeal injuries greatly reduces poor outcome, and the type of injury can be used to roughly predict patient outcome. Further, with use of current methods of diagnosis and management, almost all patients will be decannulated (98{\%}) with functional speech (100{\%}) and normal deglutition (100{\%})},

abstract = {Introduction The sickest-first principle has been pursued in the allocation of donor livers for transplantation with the introduction of algorithms based on the model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. In Germany outcomes of liver transplantation appear to be negatively influenced by the transplantation of patients with very high MELD scores and the use of donor organs with lower quality. Therefore, some have claimed, allocation should be based more on outcome-oriented criteria. Methods A survey with binary questions (yes/no) regarding the appreciation of values concerning the allocation of donor livers was performed among general medical outpatients of a university hospital. End-stage liver disease patients were excluded. Two hundred four returned forms were analyzed. Percentages of valid answers are given. Results In this study, 88{\%}, 73{\%}, and 41{\%} of subjects answered they would be willing to undergo transplantation with an estimated outcome of 20{\%}, 50{\%}, and 80{\%} 1-year mortality rate, respectively, for themselves. Choosing a possible recipient between 2 case examples, 68{\%} of valid answers voted for the case with higher age and urgency and lower long-term survival. Seventy percent said urgency was more important than long-term outcome as a criterion for organ allocation. Under the assumption that urgency-based allocation would decrease average long-term survival of liver transplantation, 58{\%} refused to deny even the sickest patients transplantation. Seventy-eight percent said that patients likely to achieve 50{\%} long-term survival should not be denied liver transplantation. Conclusion In our study a majority of subjects prioritize urgency and granting a chance to avert imminent death over long-term survival per procedure. Equitable distribution of chances for survival may be estimated more than outcome maximization in terms of aggregate life-years gained.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: About 15{\%} of liver transplantations in Eurotransplant are currently performed in patients with a high-urgency (HU) status. Patients that have acute liver failure or require an acute retransplantation can apply for this status. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of this prioritization. METHODS: Patients that were listed for liver transplantation with HU status from 01.01.2007 up to 31.12.2015 were included. Waiting list and posttransplantation outcomes were evaluated and compared with a reference group of patients with labMELD scores {\textgreater}/=40 (MELD 40+). RESULTS: In the study period, 2,299 HU patients were listed for liver transplantation. At 10 days after listing, 72{\%} of all HU patients were transplanted and 14{\%} of patients deceased. Patients with HU status for primary acute liver failure showed better patient survival at 3 years (69{\%}) as compared to patients in the MELD 40+ group (57{\%}). HU patients with labMELD{\textgreater}/=45 and patients with HU status for acute retransplantation and LabMELD{\textgreater}/=35 have significantly inferior survival at 3-year follow-up of 46{\%} and 42{\%}, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Current prioritization for patients with acute liver failure is highly effective in preventing mortality on the waiting list. Although patients with HU status for acute liver failure have good outcomes, survival is significantly inferior for patients with a high MELD score or for retransplantations. With the current scarcity of livers in mind, we should discuss whether potential recipients for a second or even third retransplantation should still receive absolute priority, with HU-status, over other recipients with an expected, substantially better prognosis after transplantation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To design a new score on risk assessment for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) based on both donor and recipient parameters. BACKGROUND: The balance of waiting list mortality and posttransplant outcome remains a difficult task in the era of the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD). METHODS: Using the United Network for Organ Sharing database, a risk analysis was performed in adult recipients of OLT in the United States of America between 2002 and 2010 (n = 37,255). Living donor-, partial-, or combined-, and donation after cardiac death liver transplants were excluded. Next, a risk score was calculated (balance of risk score, BAR score) on the basis of logistic regression factors, and validated using our own OLT database (n = 233). Finally, the new score was compared with other prediction systems including donor risk index, survival outcome following liver transplantation, donor-age combined with MELD, and MELD score alone. RESULTS: Six strongest predictors of posttransplant survival were identified: recipient MELD score, cold ischemia time, recipient age, donor age, previous OLT, and life support dependence prior to transplant. The new balance of risk score stratified recipients best in terms of patient survival in the United Network for Organ Sharing data, as in our European population. CONCLUSIONS: The BAR system provides a new, simple and reliable tool to detect unfavorable combinations of donor and recipient factors, and is readily available before decision making of accepting or not an organ for a specific recipient. This score may offer great potential for better justice and utility, as it revealed to be superior to recent developed other prediction scores.

A total of 35 nonsinging patients, 14 men and 21 women, with unilateral superior laryngeal nerve paresis were examined between 1999 and 2002. The severity of superior laryngeal nerve paresis ranged from 25{\%} to 85{\%} of normal recruitment with a mean of 70{\%} superior laryngeal nerve recruitment in men and 65{\%} in women by electromyography. In both men and women with superior laryngeal nerve paresis, the maximum phonation time and frequency range of phonation were decreased and the mean air flow rate was increased when compared with normal population values.

Tumors can be targeted with an extensive arsenal of monoclonal antibodies, ligand proteins, peptides, RNAs, and small molecules. In addition to therapeutic targeting, some of these compounds can also be applied for tumor visualization before or during surgery, after conjuga-tion with radionuclides and/or near-infrared fluorescent dyes. The majority of these tumor-targeting compounds are directed against cell membrane-bound proteins. Various categories of targetable membrane-bound proteins, such as anchoring proteins, receptors, enzymes, and transporter proteins, exist. The functions and biological characteristics of these proteins determine their location and distribution on the cell membrane, making them more, or less, acces-sible, and therefore, it is important to understand these features. In this review, we evaluate the characteristics of cancer-associated membrane proteins and discuss their overall usability for cancer targeting, especially focusing on imaging applications.

We assessed, in this study, the feasibility of performing transorale Total Laryngectomy with robotic instrumentation. Materials {\&} Methods: Transorale robotic surgery (TORS) was performed on 6 consecutive human patients with Laryngeal Squamous cell carcinoma previously treated by organ preservation protocol. This study was approved by our institutional ethical comity. Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) was performed on post operative day two, four and height to guide the rehabilitation process and timing for modified barium swallow study (MBSS). Results: After conventional tracheostomy, all procedures were completed robotically. The mean operative time was 257 min. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications or surgical mortality related to the use of Robot da Vinci system. None of the patient requires pharyngeal reconstruction with local or free flap. No pharyngeal stricture was observed. Discussion: Intraoral approach for total Laryngectomy offers a number of benefits over the traditional approach. The direct view allows for maximal mucosa sparing. TORS incision allows for a substantial improvement in pharyngeal defect size. This results in a linear horizontal closure mitigating the concerns for ischemia while reducing the possibility of pharyngeal shelf and neopharyngeal diverticula formation. Conclusion: To date, we have performed TORS-TL for both oncologic and functional indications. The goal of the present report is to share the surgical protocol successfully utilized and clinical experiences; so conclusive data may be gathered.},

abstract = {A new method for automatic voice-quality registration is presented. The method is based on a technique called phonetography, which is the registration of the dynamic range of a voice as a function of fundamental frequency. In the new phonetogram-recording method fundamental frequency (Fo) and sound-pressure level (SPL) are automatically measured and represented in an XY-diagram. Three additional acoustical voice-quality parameters are measured simultaneously with Fo and SPL: (a) jitter in the Fo as a measure for roughness, (b) the SPL difference between the 0-1.5 kHz and the 1.5-5 kHz bands as a measure for sharpness, and (c) the vocal-noise level above 5 kHz as a measure for breathiness. With this method, the voice-quality parameter values, which may change substantially as a function of Fo and SPL, are pinned to a reference position in the patient's total vocal range. Seen as a reference tool, the phonetogram opens the possibility for a more meaningful comparison of voice-quality data. Some examples, demonstrating the dependence of the chosen quality parameters on Fo and SPL are given.},

These may include several longitudinally measured responses (such as blood values relevant to the medical condition under study) and the time at which an event of particular interest occurs (e.g., death, development of a disease or dropout from the study). These outcomes are often separately analyzed; however, in many instances, a joint modeling approach is either required or may produce a better insight into the mechanisms that underlie the phenomenon under study.

Of 43 procedures where the stent upper edge was located at or below the vocal folds, granulation occurred in 21 procedures (48.84{\%}). Of 12 procedures where the stent edge was located above the vocal fold, granulation occurred in two procedures, or 16.67{\%} (odds ratio = 4.773, P = .0458, chi(2) test). Among patients in whom the stent edge was located at or below the vocal folds, the granulation complication rate was higher in those with a stent-to-vocal fold distance of {\textless}10 mm. Multivariate analysis revealed that the stent-to-vocal fold distance independently predicted granulation formation; an inverse correlation was identified between stent-to-vocal fold distance and granulation severity (n = 43, r = -.501, P = .0006; Spearman ranking test). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis further demonstrated that a stent-to-vocal fold distance cutoff value between 9.5 and 11 mm had the best accuracy in predicting granulation formation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: A stent-to-vocal fold distance of 10 mm was found to be a critical distance for discriminating granulation formation. Optimal stent-to-vocal fold distance should routinely be evaluated before stent placement.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS Transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) continues to gain popularity as a treatment modality for early glottic cancer. Oncologic outcomes have been well-defined, but there are little data to date describing functional outcomes accounting for stage of resection. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective review. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed patient-rated voice handicap and observer-rated vocal quality of patients who underwent TLM for early glottic carcinoma. Patients were grouped by European Laryngological Society (ELS) resection type, and the data were combined for ELS type I-III and compared with advanced resections (ELS IV-VI). The Voice Handicap Index (VHI) was used for patient-rated voice outcomes, and voice recordings were graded by two senior speech-language pathologists. Voice recordings and VHI scores were taken preoperatively and at least 1 month postoperatively. RESULTS No major complications were encountered. Six of 49 patients underwent repeat resection for suspicious findings with pathology, demonstrating moderate dysplasia in two cases, carcinoma in situ in two cases, and inflamed mucosa only in two cases. There was no significant difference in preoperative VHI scores or objective voice grades among patients who underwent limited (ELS I-III) and those who required more advanced (ELS IV-VI) resection. There was a significant improvement in VHI scores in patients after ELS type I to III resection, from 38.77 to 22.86 (P = .006). There was no significant difference between mean preoperative and postoperative perceptual evaluation scores in patients who underwent ELS type I, II, or III resections (62.25 and 64.32 respectively, P = .621). CONCLUSIONS Patients who undergo limited ELS resections can be assured of having a similar to improved voice after healing. Patients who undergo extended resections have poorer vocal outcomes.

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to compare (Dutch) Voice Handicap Index (VHIvumc) scores from a selected group of patients with voice problems after treatment for early glottic cancer with patients with benign voice disorders and subjects from the normal population. The study included a group of 35 patients with voice problems after treatment for early glottic cancer and a group of 197 patients with benign voice disorders. Furthermore, VHI scores were collected from 123 subjects randomly chosen from the normal population. VHI reliability was high with high internal consistency and test-retest stability. VHI scores of glottic cancer patients were similar to those of patients with voice problems due to benign lesions. Both groups of patients were clearly deviant from the normal population. Within the normal population, 16{\%} appeared to have not-normal voices. Based on ROC curves a cut-off score of 15 points was defined to identify patients with voice problems in daily life. A clinical relevant difference score of 10 points was defined to be used for individual patients and of 15 points to be used in study designs with groups. Patients with voice problems after treatment for early glottic cancer encounter the same amount of problems in daily life as the other voice-impaired patients. The VHI proved to be an adequate tool for baseline and effectiveness measurement of voice.},

abstract = {Purpose: To determine whether the delay between surgery and the beginning of radiation therapy influences survival or the risk of local-regional relapse in oropharyngeal or hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas. Methods and Materials: From 2052 patients referred to the Henri Becquerel Center for the radiation therapy of an oropharyngeal or hypopharyngeal cancer between January 1, 1981 and December 31, 1992, 420 were included in a retrospective study. Exclusion criteria were another cancer, metastasis, incomplete resection, lack of homolateral lymph node resection, or previous chemotherapy. Radiation therapy delivered 45 to 75 Gy on initial location and lymph node. Follow-up was performed until December 31, 1997. A Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to evaluate the prognostic factors. Results: The delay between surgery and radiation therapy was not found to be a significant prognostic factor for survival or risk of local-regional relapse. The only parameters found to influence local-regional and survival control were margins' pathologic state (respectively p {\textless} 0.0001 and p = 0.015) and T (p {\textless} 0.0001) and N (respectively p {\textless} 0.0001 and p = 0.0004) stages. In terms of local-regional relapse only, age was a prognostic factor (p = 0.048), and a trend was noted for tumor emboli in vessels or nerves (p = 0.061). Conclusion: In patients with oropharyngeal or hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, the delay between surgical procedure and radiation therapy does not influence survival or risk of local-regional relapse. Radiation therapy might be subjected to complete healing in these patients. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.},

Twelve patients with histologically confirmed malignancies and radiographically documented brain metastases were enrolled. Patients were scored for general performance status and neurologic function class. All subjects were given high-dose dexamethasone (HDD) for 48 hours and then randomized to receive either intermediate-dose dexamethasone (IDD) or no steroids with cranial radiotherapy. Of these 12 study patients, 3 achieved a complete response, 1 partial response, and 8 nonresponses to HDD. Seven patients had IDD, while five received no IDD. Although a small sample size prevented any statistical analysis, this study does suggest that the place for using glucocorticoids in treating patients with metastatic carcinoma to the brain remains uncertain and should be evaluated in a cooperative prospective trial.},

This article reports the results of an experiment to produce a collaborative, crowdsourced article examining a current con- troversial issue in transplant medicine (hereby referred to as the “C4 Article”). The editorial team as a whole selected the topic of organ allocation, then divided into six sections, each supported by an individual editorial team. Widely promoted by the American Journal of Transplantation, the C4 Article was open for public comment for 1 month. The nonblinded edito- rial teams reviewed the contributions daily and interacted with contributors in near–real time to clarify and expand on the content received. Draft summaries of each section were posted and subsequently revised as new contributions were received. One hundred ninety‐four individuals viewed the manuscript, and 107 individuals contributed to the manuscript during the submission period. The article engaged the interna- tional transplant community in producing a contemporary de- lineation of issues of agreement and controversy related to organ allocation and identified opportunities for new policy development. This initial experience successfully demon- strated the potential of a crowdsourced academic manuscript to advance a broad‐based understanding of a complex issue.},

Study Design: Retrospective study (1996-2011) of patients treated with RT or LS for T1a glottic squamous cell carcinoma with curative intent. Methods: Disease-free patients were assessed using Voice Handicap Index (VHI 30) and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Head and Neck Quality of Life (EORTC QLQ-HN35) questionnaires. Results: Of 147 patients, 95 (65{\%}) completed the questionnaires: fifty-one patients an average of 8 years after RT and 44 patients an average of 4 years after LS (no difference in age or sex ratio). The average total VHI 30 was 13.1 for RT and 29.2 for LS (P{\textless}.0001), with average emotional, physical and functional subscores significantly different. The average total EORTC QLQ-HN35 was 37.7 for RT versus 40.7 for LS (P=.7), with a difference only in the speaking subscore (P=.04). Conclusions: Long-term subjective voice-related quality of life was worse after LS, with no difference in other domains. These results should be interpreted in light of the biases inherent in retrospective studies. {\textcopyright} 2013 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.},

Fifty participants, 38 women and 12 men, ranging in age from 19 to 80 years, with a mean age of 49 years, served as participants. Of these 50 participants, 17 participants could be included in the acoustic analysis of voice based on measures of error calculated with the TF32 software. All participants completed the VHI and provided voice samples including three trials of the sustained vowel /ɑ/ at a comfortable loudness level as well as a connected speech sample consisting of the Zoo Passage. Acoustic measures were made with TF32 and Cool Edit software and included fundamental frequency, jitter {\%}, shimmer {\%}, signal-to-noise ratio, mean root-mean-square intensity, fundamental frequency standard deviation, aphonic periods, and breath groups. Results indicate that these measures were not predictive of overall VHI score, and no cohesive or predictable pattern was identified when comparing individual measures with overall VHI or with each subscale item. Likely contributions to this lack of correlation and subsequent clinical implica- tions are discussed, as well as the direction for further research.},

abstract = {An important target of many clinical studies is to identify biomarkers, including risk scores, with strong prognostic capabilities. While biomarker evaluations are commonly utilized to predict the progress of the disease at single time points, appropriate statistical tools to assess the prognostic value of serial biomarker evaluation are rarely used. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate flexible and appropriate statistical methodology to assess the predictive capability of serial echocardiographic measurements of allograft aortic valve function. Moreover, the concept of joint modeling of longitudinal and survival data to optimally utilize the relationship between repeated valve function measurements and time-to-death or time-to-reoperation, is introduced and illustrated. Optimal and suboptimal methods are illustrated using a prospective cohort of patients who survived aortic valve or root replacement with an allograft valve and who were followed clinically and echocardiographically over time. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Voice prosthesis is the standard of care for postlaryngectomy voice rehabilitation. We aimed to assess functional outcomes of Provox voice prosthesis, to study the impact of several clinical factors (timing of Provox insertion, type of pharyngeal closure, requirement of reconstruction, performance of myotomy, and radiotherapy) on the functional outcomes, and to record the complications associated with Provox voice prosthesis. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective nonrandomized cross-sectional observational study. METHODS: Thirty patients with postlaryngectomy speech rehabilitation with Provox prosthesis were studied. After the procedure, the patients were evaluated by a speech-language pathologist and assessed at immediate postoperative period and 6-month and 1-year interval using the parameters of functional outcomes GRBAS scale, maximal phonatory duration (MPD), and words per breath (WPB). SPSS Version 19 was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: All patients had average good voice at the end of 1 year after Provox insertion with voice quality results improving with time. Number of patients having MPD more than 7 was 21, 29, and 30 at 0 months, 6 months, and 1 year, respectively. At the end of 1 year, 11 patients had WPB score between 15 and 19. Seven patients had complications: periprosthetic leak (4), central leak (1), hypertonic segment (1), and stricture of the neopharynx (1). Primary Provox insertion, nonrequirement of postoperative radiation, cricopharyngeal myotomy, and primary and vertical closure of neopharynx had a better influence on the outcome; however, the results were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Provox voice prosthesis provides consistent and good voice results, which improve with time. Periprosthetic leak is the most common complication.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of primary myotomy on characteristics of the neoglottis in patients after laryngectomy. DESIGN: Patient survey. SETTING: University Medical Center St Radboud, Nijmegen, the Netherlands. PATIENTS: Nineteen consecutive patients who underwent laryngectomy (12 with primary lateral myotomy of the upper esophageal sphincter [marked by metal clips]; 7 not requiring myotomy [according to intraoperative palpation]). INTERVENTIONS: Videofluoroscopy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual assessments and quantitative measures of the neoglottis were used to study the relationships between myotomy, and anatomic and morphologic characteristics of the neoglottis. RESULTS: Quantitative measurements showed no difference between the neoglottic characteristics of the patients with (n = 12) and without (n = 7) myotomy, who were all judged to have moderate (n = 4) or good (n = 15) voice quality. Results for the entire patient group during phonation showed only 1 single neoglottic bar, no hypertonicity of the neoglottis, and a significant shortening of the neoglottic bar (P =.007). Results for the myotomy group during phonation showed elevation of the caudal clip (P =.046), shortening of the myotomy (P =.01), and decreased overlap of the cranial clip and the neoglottic bar (P =.007). Furthermore, significant relationships were found between the various quantitative measures of the neoglottis and those of the myotomy. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative videofluoroscopy enables study of the influence of myotomy on the anatomic and morphologic characteristics of the neoglottis. Our results suggest that a planned myotomy of the upper esophageal sphincter is beneficial when prosthetic voice rehabilitation is applied after total laryngectomy.},

abstract = {Researchers are often faced with analyzing data sets that are not complete. To prop- erly analyze such data sets requires the knowledge of the missing data mechanism. If data are missing completely at random (MCAR), then many missing data analysis techniques lead to valid inference. Thus, tests of MCAR are desirable. The package MissMech im- plements two tests developed by Jamshidian and Jalal (2010) for this purpose. These tests can be run using a function called TestMCARNormality. One of the tests is valid if data are normally distributed, and another test does not require any distributional as- sumptions for the data. In addition to testing MCAR, in some special cases, the function TestMCARNormality is also able to test whether data have a multivariate normal distribu- tion. As a bonus, the functions in MissMech can also be used for the following additional tasks: (i) test of homoscedasticity for several groups when data are completely observed, (ii) perform the k-sample test of Anderson-Darling to determine whether k groups of univariate data come from the same distribution, (iii) impute incomplete data sets using two methods, one where normality is assumed and one where no speci{\_}c distributional assumptions are made, (iv) obtain normal-theory maximum likelihood estimates for mean and covariance matrix when data are incomplete, along with their standard errors, and {\_}nally (v) perform the Neyman's test of uniformity. All of these features are explained in the paper, including examples.},

abstract = {Objectives: Laryngeal fracture patients can present with a spectrum of clinical findings ranging from normal to airway collapse and death. We will therefore examine and emphasize clinical presentation, an algorithm for appropriate diagnosis and acute airway management, and radiological or physical examination findings and demonstrate the appropriate surgical approach for optimum clinical outcome in cases of blunt and penetrating laryngeal injury. Herein, we present one of the largest series of management of laryngeal and tracheal fractures from a tertiary care level I trauma center. Study Design: A retrospective chart review from 1998 to 2008. Methods: A retrospective chart analysis on patients presenting to the head and neck trauma service. Institutional review board approval was obtained before the start of the research. Results: Our series consisted of 11 men and one woman with a mean age of 41.8 years presenting with laryngeal fractures caused by blunt (n = 10) or penetrating (n = 2) trauma. One patient presented with complete laryngotracheal separation, which was successfully managed by immediate tracheotomy and early surgical intervention. The other 11 patients had a combination of conservative (n = 6) and surgical (n = 5) management. All patients who required a tracheotomy (n = 7) were decannulated. Conclusions: Early suspicion and diagnosis of acute laryngeal and tracheal injuries are crucial. The airway must be secured via tracheotomy when possible. Computed tomography scans play a central role in diagnosis. Proper restoration of the laryngeal framework with appropriately timed open reduction and internal fixation is critical for optimal recovery of the airway, voice, and swallowing. ?? 2011 The Voice Foundation.},

abstract = {From April 1987 to April 1992, 116 phonosurgical procedures were performed to treat glottal incompetence. The initial numbers of these surgical procedures included the following: 29 primary Silastic medializations, 3 primary Silastic medializations with arytenoid adduction, 53 secondary Silastic medializations, 4 secondary Silastic medializations with arytenoid adduction, and 11 bilateral Silastic medializations. These procedures are useful in treating unilateral true vocal cord paralysis, scarring, bowing, or paresis, as well as bilateral true vocal cord bowing. Of the initial 100 patients, 16 later underwent a revision with either a larger implant's being placed or an arytenoid adduction. Primary Silastic medialization is the placement of an implant under general anesthesia in the same surgical setting in which laryngeal innervation is sacrificed. Secondary Silastic medialization is the placement of an implant under local anesthesia for a preexistent vocal cord malfunction. In either case, overall voice results for unilateral paralysis are very good. Primary Silastic medialization significantly decreases the postoperative rehabilitation period in skull base patients because of the immediate postoperative glottal competence and decreased use of perioperative tracheotomy. Bilateral implants yielded good results in 6 patients with presbylaryngis, but 6 other patients with bowing from other causes experienced only moderate improvement in speech quality. There were no implant extrusions; however, 1 implant was removed secondary to a persistent laryngocutaneous fistula in a patient who had previously undergone laryngeal irradiation. This was the only complication in this series.},

abstract = {Objectives Voice disorders that affect the quality of voice also result in varying degrees of psychological and social problems. The research question here is whether the correlations between Voice Handicap Index (VHI)-30 scores and objective acoustic measures differ in patients with different types of voice disorders. Methods The subjects were divided into three groups: muscle tension dysphonia (MTD), benign mid-membranous vocal fold lesions, and unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP). All participants were male. The mean age for the groups were 32.85 ± 8.6 years in the MTD group, 33.24 ± 7.32 years in the benign lesions group, and 34.24 ± 7.51 years in the UVFP group. The participants completed the Persian VHI-30 questionnaire. PRAAT software was used to obtain acoustic analyses. Results There was a significant correlation between the physical subscale of the VHI-30 and the total score of the VHI-30 and maximum phonation time (MPT) in the MTD group. Also, there was a significant correlation between the total VHI-30 score and the MPT value. There were relatively strong and significant correlations between the physical subscale of the VHI-30 with jitter and shimmer, harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR) for the group with benign lesions such as nodules and polyps. Also, in this group, there was a significant correlation between the total VHI-30 score and the jitter value. The physical scale had strong and significant correlations between jitter, shimmer, and HNR in the unilateral paralysis group. Conclusions Findings suggest that although the VHI-30 and the acoustic measurements of voice provide independent information, they are associated to some extent.},

Accordingly, AI could have particularly transformative applications in radiation oncology given the multifaceted and highly technical nature of this field of medicine with a heavy reliance on digital data processing and computer software. Indeed, AI has the potential to improve the accuracy, precision, efficiency and overall quality of radiation therapy for patients with cancer. In this Perspective, we first provide a general description of AI methods, followed by a high-level overview of the radiation therapy workflow with discussion of the implications that AI is likely to have on each step of this process. Finally, we describe the challenges associated with the clinical development and implementation of AI platforms in radiation oncology and provide our perspective on how these platforms might change the roles of radiotherapy medical professionals.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: Chronic liver diseases (CLDs) are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. We assessed changes in the prevalence of different types of CLD in the United States. Methods: National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys conducted between 1988 and 2008 were used to estimate changes in the prevalence and predictors of CLDs. Serologic and clinical data were used to establish the diagnoses of CLDs in 39,500 adults. Statistical analyses were conducted with SUDAAN 10.0 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC). Results: The prevalence rates for CLD were 11.78{\%} (1988-1994), 15.66{\%} (1999-2004), and 14.78{\%} (2005-2008). During the same period, the prevalence of hepatitis B virus infection (0.36{\%}, 0.33{\%}, and 0.34{\%}), hepatitis C virus (1.95{\%}, 1.97{\%}, and 1.68{\%}), and alcoholic liver disease (1.38{\%}, 2.21{\%}, and 2.05{\%}) remained generally stable. In contrast, the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) increased from 5.51{\%} to 9.84{\%} to 11.01{\%}. From 1988 to 1994, NAFLD accounted for 46.8{\%} of CLD cases; from 1994 to 2004 its prevalence increased to 62.84{\%}, and then to 75.1{\%} from 2005 to 2008. During these time periods, steady increases were observed in obesity (21.74{\%}, 30.02{\%}, and 33.22{\%}), visceral obesity (35.18{\%}, 48.16{\%}, and 51.43{\%}), type II diabetes (5.55{\%}, 7.88{\%}, and 9.11{\%}), insulin resistance (23.29{\%}, 32.50{\%}, and 35.00{\%}), and hypertension (22.68{\%}, 33.11{\%}, and 34.08{\%}). A multivariate analysis showed that during all time periods, obesity was an independent predictor of NAFLD. Conclusions: National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys data collected from 1988 to 2008 show that the prevalence of major causes of CLD remained stable, except for NAFLD, which increased steadily, along with the prevalence of metabolic conditions. Given the increasing rates of obesity, NAFLD prevalence is expected to contribute substantially to the burden of CLD in the United States. {\textcopyright} 2011 AGA Institute.},

abstract = {The field of liver transplantation has shifted considerably in the MELD era, including changing allocation, immunosuppression, and liver failure etiologies, as well as better supportive therapies. Our aim was to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the MELD score over time. The United Network for Organ Sharing provided de-identified data on 120 156 patients listed for liver transplant from 2002-2016. The ability of the MELD score to predict 90-day mortality was evaluated by a concordance (C-) statistic and corroborated with competing risk analysis. The MELD score's concordance with 90-day mortality has downtrended from 0.80 in 2003 to 0.70 in 2015. While lab MELD scores at listing and transplant climbed in that interval, score at waitlist death remained steady near 35. Listing age increased from 50 to 54 years. HCV-positive status at listing dropped from 33 to 17{\%}. The concordance of MELD and mortality does not differ with age ({\textgreater}60 = 0.73, {\textless}60 = 0.74), but is lower in diseases that are increasing most rapidly—alcoholic liver disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease—and higher in those that are declining, particularly in HCV-positive patients (HCV positive = 0.77; negative = 0.73). While MELD still predicts mortality, its accuracy has decreased; changing etiology of disease may contribute.},

Using three groups of subjects comprising liver disease, non-liver disease, and healthy controls, we have shown that serum cholinesterase activity helped to distinguish between liver disease and non-liver disease in subjects who had abnormality of a few liver function tests. Serum cholinesterase activity helped also to distinguish between the liver disease subjects and healthy controls. There was no statistically significant difference between the mean serum cholinesterase activities of non-liver disease subjects and healthy controls.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. In 2014, we reported a model for donor-recipient (D-R) matching in liver transplantation (LT) based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) from a Spanish multicenter study (Model for Allocation of Donor and Recipient in Espa{\~{n}}a [MADR-E]). The aim is to test the ANN-based methodology in a different European health care system in order to validate it. An ANN model was designed using a cohort of patients from King's College Hospital (KCH; n = 822). The ANN was trained and tested using KCH pairs for both 3- and 12-month survival models. End points were probability of graft survival (correct classification rate [CCR] ) and nonsurvival (minimum sensitivity [MS]). The final model is a rule-based system for facilitating the decision about the most appropriate D-R matching. Models designed for KCH had excellent prediction capabilities for both 3 months (CCR–area under the curve [AUC]  = 0.94; MS-AUC = 0.94) and 12 months (CCR-AUC = 0.78; MS-AUC = 0.82), almost 15{\%} higher than the best obtained by other known scores such as Model for End-Stage Liver Disease and balance of risk. Moreover, these results improve the previously reported ones in the multicentric MADR-E database. In conclusion, the use of ANN for D-R matching in LT in other health care systems achieved excellent prediction capabilities supporting the validation of these tools. It should be considered as the most advanced, objective, and useful tool to date for the management of waiting lists. Liver Transplantation 24 192–203 2018 AASLD.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: Primary non-function and ischaemic cholangiopathy are the most feared complications following donation-after-circulatory-death (DCD) liver transplantation. The aim of this study was to design a new score on risk assessment in liver-transplantation DCD based on donor-and-recipient parameters. Methods: Using the UK national DCD database, a risk analysis was performed in adult recipients of DCD liver grafts in the UK between 2000 and 2015 (n = 1,153). A new risk score was calculated (UK DCD Risk Score) on the basis of a regression analysis. This is validated using the United Network for Organ Sharing database (n = 1,617) and our own DCD liver-transplant database (n = 315). Finally, the new score was compared with two other available prediction systems: the DCD risk scores from the University of California, Los Angeles and King's College Hospital, London. Results: The following seven strongest predictors of DCD graft survival were identified: functional donor warm ischaemia, cold ischaemia, recipient model for end-stage liver disease, recipient age, donor age, previous orthotopic liver transplantation, and donor body mass index. A combination of these risk factors (UK DCD risk model) stratified the best recipients in terms of graft survival in the entire UK DCD database, as well as in the United Network for Organ Sharing and in our own DCD population. Importantly, the UK DCD Risk Score significantly predicted graft loss caused by primary non-function or ischaemic cholangiopathy in the futile group ({\textgreater}10 score points). The new prediction model demonstrated a better C statistic of 0.79 compared to the two other available systems (0.71 and 0.64, respectively). Conclusions: The UK DCD Risk Score is a reliable tool to detect high-risk and futile combinations of donor-and-recipient factors in DCD liver transplantation. It is simple to use and offers a great potential for making better decisions on which DCD graft should be rejected or may benefit from functional assessment and further optimization by machine perfusion. Lay summary: In this study, we provide a new prediction model for graft loss in donation-after-circulatory-death (DCD) liver transplantation. Based on UK national data, the new UK DCD Risk Score involves the following seven clinically relevant risk factors: donor age, donor body mass index, functional donor warm ischaemia, cold storage, recipient age, recipient laboratory model for end-stage liver disease, and retransplantation. Three risk classes were defined: low risk (0–5 points), high risk (6–10 points), and futile ({\textgreater}10 points). This new model stratified best in terms of graft survival compared to other available models. Futile combinations ({\textgreater}10 points) achieved an only very limited 1- and 5-year graft survival of 37{\%} and less than 20{\%}, respectively. In contrast, an excellent graft survival has been shown in low-risk combinations (≤5 points). The new model is easy to calculate at the time of liver acceptance. It may help to decide which risk combination will benefit from additional graft treatment, or which DCD liver should be declined for a certain recipient.},

This retrospective cohort study describes trends in the use of exceptions among the pediatric liver waitlist population with chronic liver disease. The cohort (n = 3728) included all children with a diagnosis of chronic liver disease listed in the United Network for Organ Sharing transplant database for first isolated liver transplant between February 27, 2002 and March 31, 2013. Exception score requests were common (34{\%}); 90{\%} of requests were approved.

Patients of non-White race had exception score request rates 13{\%} lower than patients of White race (IRR 0.87, 95{\%} CI 0.77-0.98, p = 0.02). Older patients had lower rates of exception score requests than younger patients (p = 0.03). Request rates varied by region.

The best boundaries and coefficients were never calculated for any region outside the US. Therefore, this study refits MELD (reMELD) for the Eurotransplant region. Methods All adult patients listed for a first LT between 01.01.2007-31.12.2018 were included. Data was randomly split in a training (70{\%}) and validation (30{\%}) set. In the training data, generalized additive models (GAMs) with splines were plotted for each MELD parameter. The lower and upper bound combinations with the maximum log-likelihood were chosen for the final models. The refit models were tested in the validation data with c-indices and Brier scores. Through likelihood ratio tests the refit models were compared to UNOS-MELD. The correlation between scores and survival of prioritized patients was calculated. Results A total of 6,684 patients were included. Based on training data, refit parameters were capped at creatinine 0.7-2.5, bilirubin 0.3-27, INR 0.1-2.6 and sodium 120-139. ReMELD and reMELD-Na showed c-indices of 0.866 and 0.869 respectively. ReMELD-Na prioritized patients with 1.6 times higher 90-day mortality probabilities as compared to UNOS-MELD. Conclusion Refitting MELD resulted in new lower and upper bounds for each parameter. The predictive power of reMELD-Na was significantly higher than UNOS-MELD. ReMELD prioritized patients with higher 90-day mortality rates. Thus, reMELD(-Na) should replace UNOS-MELD for liver graft allocation in the Eurotransplant region.},

We initiated a comprehensive performance improvement intervention in all head and neck surgery patients intended to reduce postoperative infection and fistulae rates. We report our review of outcomes within laryngectomy patients. STUDY DESIGN: Case series with chart review. SETTING: Academic tertiary referral center. SUBJECTS: Nineteen laryngectomy patients at risk of postoperative fistula formation. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of all patients who had undergone laryngectomy procedures between January 2013 and April 2014. Clinicodemographic data were obtained, including history of diabetes, prior radiation therapy, type of reconstruction performed for closure of the pharyngeal defect, and the presence or absence of postoperative fistula. RESULTS: The study population comprised 19 laryngectomy patients. Prior to implementation of our performance improvement intervention, 8 of 11 (73{\%}) patients undergoing laryngectomy developed postoperative fistulae. After intervention, 0 of 8 patients developed fistulae (P = .002). Prior radiation, diabetes mellitus, and overall stage were not associated with a reduction in fistula rate (P {\textgreater} .05). CONCLUSION: Comprehensive uniform application of a standard antibiotic prophylaxis, surgical technique, perioperative care, and treatment of comorbid conditions can significantly reduce and potentially eliminate fistulae in laryngectomy patients who are especially at risk.},

When adequate mucosal tissue is not available, pharyngeal reconstruction with free flaps can be utilized. The speech outcomes of these patients have been traditionally considered inferior based on the findings of a limited number of studies. We report the results of a review of our experience with radial forearm free flap (RFFF) reconstruction of extensive laryngopharyngectomy defects vs our institutional outcomes seen with primary closure. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: All patients treated with laryngectomy procedures with either primary closure (28 patients) or RFFF (20 patients) reconstructions at the Cleveland Clinic from 2002 through 2007 were included. Blinded evaluation with statistical analysis of standard speech outcomes measures (maximal sustained phonation, fluent count) as well as qualitative variables are reported. RESULTS: Based on our data collection, the two groups are statistically indistinguishable. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the utility and effectiveness of the RFFF in pharyngeal reconstruction in achieving good voice outcomes.},

Clinical data were extracted for all adult primary liver transplantation candidates from our institution who were listed with the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) between 1990 and 1999. Serum creatinine, bilirubin, and international normalized ratio (INR) were obtained from an institutional laboratory database. Cox models were constructed using current MELD, change in MELD (Delta), and number of MELD scores to predict survival on the waiting list. Eight hundred and sixty-one patients met inclusion criteria, 639 underwent transplantation, and 80 died while waiting. A one-unit increment in current MELD imparted significant hazard ratios ranging from 1.12 to 1.19 in all models. Delta MELD was predictive of mortality univariately, but less predictive when current MELD was included, and not predictive when considered with both current and number of MELD scores. Overall, current MELD is the single most important determinant of mortality risk on the waiting list. Delta MELD is predictive of death only within 4 d of the event; however, part of this correlates with the dying process itself, thus limiting Delta MELD's utility in survival prediction models.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyze quality of life, functional outcome, and hidden costs by primary treatment with surgery or radiation therapy in patients with early glottic cancer. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study in a tertiary care facility. METHODS: A group of 101 patients with carcinoma in situ and T1 invasive squamous cell carcinoma treated primarily with either surgery or radiation, between January 1990 and December 2000, were identified from searching our tumor registry. Patients completed two previously validated questionnaires and one local questionnaire. Statistical significance was assessed with the rank sum test, chi2 test, or Fisher's Exact test. RESULTS: Questionnaires were completed in 59{\%} (44 of 74) of the surgical cohort and 41{\%} (11 of 27) of the radiation therapy cohort. The primary surgical treatments were endoscopic excision (86{\%}), hemilaryngectomy (12{\%}), and total laryngectomy (1{\%}). Patient-reported problems with swallowing, chewing, speech, taste, saliva, pain, activity, recreation, and appearance showed no difference between the endoscopic excision or radiation therapy cohorts. Comparing endoscopic excision versus radiation therapy, respectively, median number of treatments (2 vs. 35), total median travel distance (150 vs. 660 miles), total median travel time (180 vs. 1440 min), and total median number of hours of work missed (76 vs. 24) all differed significantly (P {\textless}.01). CONCLUSIONS: Almost all patients with early glottic cancer, whether treated with surgery or radiation therapy, reported excellent quality of life outcomes and functional results. In addition to actual costs, the hidden costs for radiation therapy versus endoscopic excision were all greater in terms of total number of hours of work missed, total travel time, and total travel distance.},

abstract = {Failure to account for time-dependent treatment use when developing a prognostic model can result in biased future predictions. We reviewed currently available methods to account for treatment use when developing a prognostic model. First, we defined the estimands targeted by each method and examined their mechanisms of action with directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Next, methods were implemented in data from 1,906 patients; 325 received selective $\beta$-blockers (SBBs) during follow-up. We demonstrated seven Cox regression modeling strategies: (a) ignoring SBB treatment; (b) excluding SBB users or (c) censoring them when treated; (d) inverse probability of treatment weighting after censoring (IPCW), including SBB treatment as (e) a binary or (f) a time-dependent covariate; and (g) marginal structural modeling (MSM). Using DAGs, we demonstrated IPCW and MSM have the best properties and target a similar estimand. In the case study, compared to (a), approaches (b) and (e) provided predictions that were 1{\%} and 2{\%} higher on average. Performance (c-statistic, Brier score, calibration slope) varied minimally between approaches. Our review of methods confirmed that ignoring treatment is theoretically inferior, but differences between the prediction models obtained using different methods can be modest in practice. Future simulation studies and applications are needed to assess the value of applying IPCW or MSM to adjust for treatments in different treatment and disease settings.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Stapling devices are used for pharyngeal closure after laryngectomy for the past few decades although it has not gained wide acceptance. This study is aimed at evaluating the role of stapler in pharyngeal closure after laryngectomy. METHODS: Thirty consecutive patients who underwent stapled laryngectomy at our institution from October 2004 to February 2008 were evaluated retrospectively. Linear stapler (Proximate TX 60; Ethicon Inc.) was used for closure of neopharynx. RESULTS: There were 28 males and 2 females with mean age of 54.5 years (54.5 +/- 11.2). Nineteen of these patients (63.3{\%}) had salvage laryngectomy and two patients (6.7{\%}) had laryngectomy for a second primary tumor. Twenty-eight patients had total laryngectomy (TL), whereas two had extended TL. Eight patients had salivary leak (26.7{\%}). Of these, 6 (75{\%}) had prior radiation. All salivary leaks except one were managed conservatively. Follow-up ranged from 7 to 54 months (median: 21 months). Seven patients (23.3{\%}) developed recurrence, six at the stoma, of which 5 (83.3{\%}) had initial extension of disease to the subglottis. Four-year disease-free survival was 54.4{\%}. CONCLUSION: Pharyngeal closure by linear stapler is an efficient and safe method of fashioning the neopharynx after laryngectomy with no added risk of occurrence of pharyngocutaneous fistula in primary and salvage laryngectomies.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION Colorectal surgeries (CRS) have one of the highest rates of surgical site infections (SSIs) with rates 15 to {\textgreater}30{\%}. Prevention "bundles" or sets of evidence-based interventions are structured ways to improve patient outcomes. The aim sof this study is to evaluate CRS SSI prevention bundles, bundle components, and implementation and compliance strategies. METHODS A meta-analysis of studies with pre- and post-implementation data was conducted to assess the impact of bundles on SSI rates (superficial, deep, and organ/space). Subgroup analysis of bundle components identified optimal bundle designs. RESULTS Thirty-five studies (51,413 patients) were identified and 23 (17,557 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. A SSI risk reduction of 40{\%} (p {\textless} 0.001) was noted with 44{\%} for superficial SSI (p {\textless} 0.001) and 34{\%} for organ/space (p = 0.048). Bundles with sterile closure trays (58.6 vs 33.1{\%}), MBP with oral antibiotics (55.4 vs 31.8{\%}), and pre-closure glove changes (56.9 vs 28.5{\%}) had significantly greater SSI risk reduction. CONCLUSION Bundles can effectively reduce the risk of SSIs after CRS, by fostering a cohesive environment, standardization, and reduction in operative variance. If implemented successfully and complied with, bundles can become vital to improving patients' surgical quality of care.},

abstract = {Salivary bypass tubes (SBT) are increasingly used to prevent pharyngocutaneous fistula (PCF) following laryngectomy and pharyngolaryngectomy. There is minimal evidence as to their efficacy and literature is limited. The aim of the study was to determine if SBT prevent PCF. The study was a multicentre retrospective case control series (level of evidence 3b). Patients who underwent laryngectomy or pharyngolaryngectomy for cancer or following cancer treatment between 2011 and 2014 were included in the study. The primary outcome was development of a PCF. Other variables recorded were age, sex, prior radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy, prior tracheostomy, type of procedure, concurrent neck dissection, use of flap reconstruction, use of prophylactic antibiotics, the suture material used for the anastomosis, tumour T stage, histological margins, day one post-operative haemoglobin and whether a salivary bypass tube was used. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed. A total of 199 patients were included and 24 received salivary bypass tubes. Fistula rates were 8.3{\%} in the SBT group (2/24) and 24.6{\%} in the control group (43/175). This was not statistically significant on univariate (p value 0.115) or multivariate analysis (p value 0.076). In addition, no other co-variables were found to be significant. No group has proven a benefit of salivary bypass tubes on multivariate analysis. The study was limited by a small case group, variations in tube duration and subjects given a tube may have been identified as high risk of fistula. Further prospective studies are warranted prior to recommendation of salivary bypass tubes following laryngectomy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is an increasing choice of voice outcome research tools, but good comparative data are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the reliability and validity of three voice-specific, self-reported scales. DESIGN: Longitudinal, cohort comparison study. SETTING: Two UK voice clinics: the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne, and the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and eighty-one patients presenting with dysphonia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All patients completed the vocal performance questionnaire, the voice handicap index and the voice symptom scale. For comparison, each patient's voice was recorded and assessed perceptually using the grade-roughness-breathiness-aesthenia-strain scale. The reliability and validity of the three self-reported vocal performance measures were assessed in all subjects, while 50 completed the questionnaires again to assess repeatability. RESULTS: The results of the 170 participants with completed data sets showed that all three questionnaires had high levels of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.81-0.95) and repeatability (voice handicap index = 0.83; vocal performance questionnaire = 0.75; voice symptom scale = 0.63). Concurrent and criterion validity were also good, although, of the grade-roughness-breathiness-aesthenia-strain subscales, roughness was the least well correlated with the self-reported measures. CONCLUSION: The vocal performance questionnaire, the voice handicap index and the voice symptom scale are all reliable and valid instruments for measuring the patient-perceived impact of a voice disorder.},

abstract = {Objective The purpose of this study was to clarify the sex differences in pitch range (PR) and speech fundamental frequency (SFF) after arytenoid adduction (AA) combined with type 1 thyroplasty (TP1) in patients with unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) and to assess the cause of these differences. Study Design This is a retrospective review of clinical records. Methods The records of 50 patients with UVFP for whom PR, SFF, and maximum phonation time (MPT) had been evaluated before and 1 year after AA combined with TP1 were analyzed. Patients consisted of 36 men and 14 women. In particular, in the 37 patients (24 men and 13 women) who had ???2 semitones (STs) in preoperative PR (pre-PR), the differences and correlations between the pre-PR and the postoperative PR (post-PR), SFF, and MPT were compared between the sexes. We also discussed cases of post-PR deterioration and abnormal SFF. Results The characteristics of PR in men are narrow pre-PR (14.7 ?? 11.5 STs) and significant extension of post-PR (22.6 ?? 6.3 STs). MPT extended from 4.6 ?? 2.5 seconds to 14.8 ?? 7.2 seconds. In contrast, women had a wide pre-PR (18.1 ?? 7.2 STs) and showed no significant post-PR extension (21.7 ?? 7.8 STs). MPT extended from 5.1 ?? 1.9 seconds to 16.8 ?? 7.2 seconds. Although there were no significant changes in average SFF, as well as the highest and lowest pitch after the operation, the variance of the pre-SFF tended to converge into the physiological range in the post-SFF (P = 0.08). Compared with the SFF data of normal adult controls, post-SFF in the normal range was 46.0{\%} (23/50). In patients who showed a {\textgreater}20{\%} improvement in PR, normal post-SFF appeared in 68.8{\%} of the patients (11/16). Particularly in those women, 83.3{\%} (5/6) showed a normal post-SFF. Men showed greater difficulty in recovery of normal PR, SFF, and MPT; however, there were fewer patients (4.2{\%}; 1/24) with a PR deterioration of {\textgreater}20{\%}. Regarding women, although some patients showed a parallel recovery in PR and SFF to the normal range, there was a high rate of patients showing PR deterioration (30.8{\%}; 4/13). Conclusions AA combined with TP1 resulted in the recovery of not only MPT but also PR and SFF. In addition, sex differences in operative effects were suggested. In men, although MPT is difficult to be fully recovered, PR deterioration was mild. In women, although MPT was more easily extended, PR deterioration occurred more readily because of operative effects such as hypermedialization of their smaller larynx. The post-PR variation appeared to be associated with SFF. Our results indicate the necessity to assess patients' PR and SFF even if their MPTs recover, particularly in patients with postoperative voice insufficiency.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims The current organ allocation system for liver transplantation (LT) creates an imbalance between patients with and without hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We describe a model designed to re-establish allocation equity among patient groups using transplant benefit as the common endpoint. Methods We enrolled consecutive adult patients entering the waiting list (WL group, n = 2697) and undergoing LT (LT group, n = 1702) during the period 2004-2009 in the North Italy Transplant program area. Independent multivariable regressions (WL and LT models) were created for patients without HCC and for those with stage T2 HCC. Monte Carlo simulation was used to create distributions of transplant benefit, and covariates such as Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) were combined in regression equations. These equations were then calibrated to create an "MELD equivalent" which matches HCC patients to non-HCC patients having the same numerical MELD score. Results Median 5 year transplant benefit was 15.12 months (8.75-25.35) for the non-HCC patients, and 28.18 months (15.11-36.38) for the T2-HCC patients (p {\textless}0.001). Independent predictors of transplant benefit were MELD score (estimate = 0.89, p {\textless}0.001) among non-HCC patients, and MELD (estimate = 1.14, p {\textless}0.001) and logAFP (estimate = -0.46, p {\textless}0.001) among HCC patients. The equation "HCC-MELD" = 1.27 {\^{a}}̂ - MELD - 0.51 {\^{a}}̂ - logAFP + 4.59 calculates a numerical score for HCC patients, whereby their transplant benefit is equal to that of non-HCC patients with the same numerical value for MELD. Conclusions We describe a method for calibrating HCC and non-HCC patients according to survival benefit, and propose that this method has the potential, if externally validated, to restore equity to the organ allocation system.},

abstract = {Purpose: Prognostic factors in 1292 patients with brain metastases, treated in a single institution were identified in order to determine subgroups of patients suitable for selection in future trials. Materials and Methods: From January 1981 through December 1990, 1292 patients with CT- diagnosed brain metastases were referred to the Department of Radiation Oncology, Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam. The majority of patients were treated with whole brain radiotherapy (84{\%}), the remainder were treated with steroids only or surgery and radiotherapy. Information on potential prognostic factors (age, sex, performance status, number and distribution of brain metastases, site of primary tumor, histology, interval between primary tumor and brain metastases, systemic tumor activity, serum lactate dehydrogenase, response to steroid treatment, and treatment modality) was collected. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine significant prognostic factors. Results were compared with literature findings using a review of prognostic factors in 18 published reports. Results: Overall median survival was 3.4 months, with 6-month, 1-year, and 2- year survival percentages of 36{\%}, 12{\%}, and 4{\%} respectively. Survival was statistically significantly different between treatment modalities, with median survival of 1.3 months in patients treated with steroids only, 3.6 months in patients treated with radiotherapy, and 8.9 months in patients treated with neurosurgery followed by radiotherapy (p {\textless} 0.0001). Multivariate analysis confirmed literature findings of the major prognostic value of treatment modality on survival of patients with brain metastases. Performance status, response to steroid treatment, systemic tumor activity, and serum lactate dehydrogenase were independent prognostic factors with the strongest impact on survival, second only to treatment modality. Site of primary tumor, age, and number of brain metastases were also identified as prognostic factors in our material, although with lesser importance. In patients with lung primaries, sex was found to have significant impact on survival. In patients with breast primaries, interval between primary tumor and development of brain metastases appeared to be a statistically significant prognostic factor. Histology in patients with lung primaries and distribution of brain metastases were not found to be statistically significant in multivariate analysis. Conclusions: In this large database, the value of established prognostic factors was confirmed and, furthermore, some less well-recognized parameters such as response to steroid treatment, serum lactate dehydrogenase, age, sex in lung primaries, and site of primary tumor were established. From the three strongest prognostic factors-performance status, response to steroids, and evidence of systemic disease-simple identification of favorable and unfavorable subgroups of patients with brain metastases can be constructed.},

abstract = {Given the high waiting list mortality, there is a clear need to identify strategies to increase the number of livers for transplantation. Some strategies require policy changes, whereas others depend on a better understanding of available opportunities. We divided the strategies to increase the number of livers for transplantation into two categories—those aiming to increase the use of organs considered to be of suboptimal quality, and those aiming to increase the use of organs considered to be of suboptimal size. Enough evidence suggests that, if considered in the context of other donor and recipient variables, grafts from elderly donors are a safe option. The severity of steatosis, and not simply its presence, is an important factor in contemplating the utility of steatotic grafts. Use of organs that have steatosis together with other factors that define extended-criteria organs should be avoided, particularly prolonged cold ischaemia time. Donation after circulatory death has an important role in increasing the donor pool, given the wide availability of organs from donors with this cause of death. This type of donation is hampered by a higher risk of ischaemia-reperfusion injury than other types of donation, which can result in graft complications and potential graft loss. Different types of machine perfusion have the potential to overcome these issues, and further research is needed to establish the best techniques and most cost-effective models. Despite the scarcity of data, the availability of safe and highly effective antiviral therapies means that the use of donors infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) in recipients who are HCV negative can be considered as a strategy to increase the donor pool. Although data on transplantations using livers from living donors in patients with a Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score higher than 20–24 are scarce, outcomes are similar to those achieved in patients with lower MELD scores, at least in reference centres. Increased use of split livers is an option if donors and recipients are carefully selected.},

Dysphagia may result from many factors, including the type of laryngectomy surgery employed and the use of adjuvant treatments (e.g. radiotherapy and chemotherapy). Dysphagia may also be compounded by other co-morbid factors, such as ageing and depression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAIM: To investigate the methods of surgical closure used by Australian ENT and head and neck surgeons after undertaking total laryngectomy surgery.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: In order to audit surgical variation, 56 short questionnaires were sent to all Australian ENT and head and neck surgeons who were registered members of the Australia and New Zealand Head and Neck Society.

abstract = {Aortic gradient and aortic regurgitation are echocardiographic markers of aortic valve function. Both are biomarkers repeatedly measured in patients with valve abnormalities, and thus, it is expected that they are biologically interrelated. Loss of follow-up could be caused by multiple reasons, including valve progression related, such as an intervention or even the death of the patient. In that case, it would be of interest and appropriate to analyze these outcomes jointly. Joint models have recently received much attention because they cover a wide range of clinical applications and have promising results. We propose a joint model consisting of two longitudinal outcomes, one continuous (aortic gradient) and one ordinal (aortic regurgitation), and two time-to-events (death and reoperation). Moreover, we allow for more flexibility for the average evolution and the subject-specific profiles of the continuous repeated outcome by using B-splines. A disadvantage, however, is that when adopting a non-linear structure for the model, we may have difficulties when interpreting the results. To overcome this problem, we propose a graphical approach. In this paper, we apply the proposed joint models under the Bayesian framework, using a data set including serial echocardiographic measurements of aortic gradient and aortic regurgitation and measurements of the occurrence of death and reoperation in patients who received a human tissue valve in the aortic position. The interpretation of the results will be discussed. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

Successful techniques for closure include multiple layers of tissue, selected suture materials, the application of postoperative radiation therapy, and modified neck dissection. In addition, vocal rehabilitation has been traditionally associated with the formation of a pharyngoesophageal segment capable of producing sound after air insufflation. A three-year experience with 129 patients after they underwent a total laryngectomy and tracheoesophageal shunt showed that 16 patients (12{\%}) failed to achieve satisfactory speech after tracheoesophageal puncture because of pharyngoesophageal spasm. Response to percutaneous block of the pharyngeal plexus and subsequent myotomy of the cricopharyngeus and pharyngeal constrictor muscles was assessed in 14 patients. Increased pharyngoesophageal tone after total laryngectomy seems to be an important factor in the failure to acquire esophageal voice.},

The study's objective was to determine the incidence of post-laryngectomy fistulas in patients operated on in our department to establish whether specific factors predispose to fistula formation and to determine whether fistulas and tumor recurrence are related. Between 1992 and 2001, 377 cases of laryngeal carcinoma were diagnosed, and the patients underwent total laryngectomy in our department. Of these patients, 291 had total laryngectomy as the primary management of their disease, while in 86 patients the operation treated recurrence of the disease. In 92 patients, total laryngectomy was combined with radical or eclectic neck dissection. The presence of early postoperative fistula was established in 49 of the 377 patients (13{\%}) studied. The cancerous stage, exact localization of the tumor, degree of differentiation, previous irradiation, patient's age, performance or not of neck dissection or emergency tracheostomy and fitting of voice prostheses were all factors that, after statistical analysis, did not appear to significantly influence the incidence of postoperative fistulas. Factors that did show statistical significance were the histological infiltration of the tumor's surgical margins (11{\%} negative vs. 38{\%} with positive margins) and coexisting early complications. Fistula management was conservative in the majority of cases. The necessary closure period for a fistula varied between 5 and 81 days (mean: 29 days). Postoperative follow-up of all patients revealed that fistulas did not influence the incidence of tumor recurrence. The incidence of postoperative fistulas in our study was 13{\%}. Incomplete excision of the tumor and coexisting complications were related, among other things, to a higher rate of fistula formation. The rate of tumor recurrence after total laryngectomy was not related to the presence of a fistula during the postoperative period.},

abstract = {The successful production of voice with a tracheoesophageal puncture (TEP) and voice prosthesis requires a compliant pharyngoesophageal segment. Speech failure is commonly attributed to spasm of the pharyngoesophageal segment. During total laryngectomy (TL), a 3-layer closure is typically performed. This prospective single-arm study examines the safety and efficacy of TL and TEP with nonclosure of the pharyngeal musculature to prevent pharyngoesophageal spasm as an alternative to 3-layer closure with pharyngeal plexus neurectomy and/or pharyngeal constrictor myotomy. Twenty-one consecutive patients were enrolled by a single surgeon. The mean duration of follow-up was 19.5 +/- 7.9 months. Surgical complications and voice rehabilitation outcomes were examined. An overall complication rate of 28.5{\%} was observed. Fluency was achieved in 75{\%} of patients within a mean of 4.3 +/- 5.1 months. Speech failure was attributable to early primary site and neck recurrence (5{\%}), hypoglossal nerve palsy (5{\%}), hypopharyngeal stricture and recurrence (5{\%}), dementia (5{\%}), and intransigent alcohol abuse (5{\%}). Pharyngoesophageal spasm was not observed in any subjects. We conclude that primary TEP with nonclosure of the pharyngeal muscle during TL is relatively safe. Furthermore, it is preferable over 3-layer closure because it avoids pharyngoesophageal spasm, a factor limiting voice rehabilitation.},

abstract = {BAKGROUND {\&} AIMS: Although discrimination of the model for end stage liver disease (MELD) is generally considered acceptable, its calibration is still unclear. In a validation study, we assessed the discrimination and calibration performance of 3 versions of the model: original MELD-TIPS, used to predict survival after transjugular intra-hepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS); classic MELD-Mayo; MELD-UNOS, used by United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). Recalibration and model updating were also explored. METHODS: 776 patients submitted to elective TIPS (TIPS cohort), and 445 unselected patients (non-TIPS cohort) were included. Three, 6 and 12-month mortality predictions were calculated by the 3 MELD versions: discrimination was assessed by c-statistics and calibration by comparing deciles of predicted and observed risks. Cox and Fine and Grey models were used for recalibration and prognostic analyses. RESULTS: Major patient characteristics in TIPS/non-TIPS cohorts were: viral etiology 402/188, alcoholic 185/130, NASH 65/33; mean follow-up± SD 25±9/19±21months; 3-6-12 month mortality were respectively, 57-102-142/31-47-99. C-statistics ranged from 0.66 to 0.72 in TIPS and 0.66 to 0.76 in non-TIPS cohorts across prediction times and scores. A post-hoc analysis revealed worse c-statistics in non-viral cirrhosis with more pronounced and significant worsening in non-TIPS cohort. Calibration was acceptable with MELD-TIPS but largely unsatisfactory with MELD-Mayo and -UNOS whose performance improved much after recalibration. A prognostic analysis showed that age, albumin, and TIPS indication might be used for a MELD updating. CONCLUSIONS: In this validation study the MELD performance was largely unsatisfactory, particularly in non-viral cirrhosis. MELD recalibration and candidate variables for a MELD updating are proposed. LAY SUMMARY: While discrimination performance of the Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) is credited to be fair to good, its calibration, the correspondence of observed to predicted mortality, is still unsettled. We found that application of 3 different versions of the MELD in two independent cirrhosis cohorts yielded largely imprecise mortality predictions particularly in non-viral cirrhosis and propose a validated model recalibration. Candidate variables for a MELD updating are proposed.},

abstract = {Several epidemiological studies have shown a positive association between adult height and cancer incidence. The only study conducted among women on mouth and pharynx cancer risk, however, reported an inverse association. This study aims to investigate the association between height and the risk of head and neck cancer (HNC) within a large international consortium of HNC. We analyzed pooled individual-level data from 24 case-control studies participating in the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology Consortium. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated separately for men and women for associations between height and HNC risk. Educational level, tobacco smoking, and alcohol consumption were included in all regression models. Stratified analyses by HNC subsites were performed. This project included 17,666 cases and 28,198 controls. We found an inverse association between height and HNC (adjusted OR per 10 cm height = 0.91; 95{\%} CI 5 0.86-0.95 for men; adjusted OR = 0.86; 95{\%} CI 5 0.79-0.93 for women). In men, the estimated OR did vary by educational level, smoking status, geographic area, and control source. No differences by subsites were detected. Adult height is inversely associated with HNC risk. As height can be considered a marker of childhood illness and low energy intake, the inverse association is consistent with prior studies showing that HNC occur more frequently among deprived individuals. Further studies designed to elucidate the mechanism of such association would be warranted.},

abstract = {Brain metastases are the most common intracranial tumors and their incidence is increasing. Untreated brain metastases are associated with a poor prognosis and a poor performance status. The role of surgery in the management of multiple brain metastases is still controversial. As more than 70{\%} of patients have multiple metastases at the time of diagnosis, whole brain radiotherapy is the treatment of choice in most cases. Brain metastases are an ideal target for stereotactic radiosurgery, as they are better circumscribed than primary brain tumors. Currently, chemotherapy has a limited role in the treatment of most brain metastases. Several new therapies, with a good penetration through the blood brain barrier, such as temozolomide, have been used in brain metastases with different results depending on the histology of the primary tumor. A better understanding of the complex processes underlying the development of brain metastasis will enable us to develop more satisfactory targeted treatments. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Because of its antitumor cytostatic action and its anticonvulsant effect, the pineal hormone melatonin could constitute a new effective agent in the treatment of brain metastases. The current study was performed to evaluate the effect of melatonin on the survival time in patients with brain metastases due to solid neoplasms. METHODS: The study included 50 patients, who were randomized to be treated with supportive care alone (steroids plus anticonvulsant agents) or with supportive care plus melatonin (20 mg/day at 8:00 p.m. orally). RESULTS: The survival at 1 year, free-from-brain-progression period, and mean survival time were significantly higher in patients treated with melatonin than in those who received the supportive care alone. Conversely, steroid-induced metabolic and infective complications were significantly more frequent in patients treated with supportive care alone than in those concomitantly treated with melatonin. CONCLUSIONS: The pineal hormone melatonin may be able to improve the survival time and the quality of life in patients with brain metastases due to solid tumors.},

abstract = {Background: Tacrolimus (TAC) is an immunosuppressant drug given to kidney transplant recipients post-transplant to prevent antibody formation and kidney rejection. The optimal therapeutic dose for TAC is poorly defined and therapy requires frequent monitoring of drug trough levels. Analyzing the association between TAC levels over time and the development of potentially harmful de novo donor specific antibodies (dnDSA) is complex because TAC levels are subject to measurement error and dnDSA is assessed at discrete times, so it is an interval censored time-to-event outcome. Methods: Using data from the University of Colorado Transplant Center, we investigated the association between TAC and dnDSA using a shared random effects (intercept and slope) model with longitudinal and interval censored survival sub-models (JM) and compared it with the more traditional interval censored survival model with a time-varying covariate (TVC). We carried out simulations to compare bias, level and power for the association parameter in the TVC and JM under varying conditions of measurement error and interval censoring. In addition, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods allowed us to calculate clinically relevant quantities along with credible intervals (CrI). Results: The shared random effects model was a better fit and showed both the average TAC and the slope of TAC were associated with risk of dnDSA. The simulation studies demonstrated that, in the presence of heavy interval censoring and high measurement error, the TVC survival model underestimates the association between the survival and longitudinal measurement and has inflated type I error and considerably less power to detect associations. Conclusions: To avoid underestimating associations, shared random effects models should be used in analyses of data with interval censoring and measurement error.},

Thus, to determine the graft quality, the Donor Risk Index and the Eurotransplant Donor Risk Index have been proposed. In a previous study we showed that neither could be validated on the French database. Our aim was then dedicated to propose an adaptive Donor Quality Index (DQI) using data from 3961 liver transplantation (LT) performed in France between 2009 and 2013, with an external validation based on 1048 French LT performed in 2014. Using Cox models and three different methods of selection, we developed a new score and defined groups at risk. Model performance was assessed by means of three measures of discrimination corrected by the optimism using a bootstrap procedure. An external validation was also performed in order to evaluate its calibration and discrimination. Five donor covariates were retained: Age, cause of death, intensive care unit stay, lowest MDRD creatinine clearance, and liver type. Three groups at risk could be discriminated. The performances of the model were satisfactory after internal validation. Calibration and discrimination were preserved in the external validation dataset. The DQI exhibited good properties and is potentially adaptive as an aid for better guiding decision making for LT.},

The number of D–/R+ transplants decreased from 2010 in 2008 to 1334 in 2017, with this decline particularly noticeable since 2015. D–/R+ patients in the DAA era (n = 7107) were older, had higher rates of hepatocellular carcinoma, and lower Model for End-Stage Liver Disease scores than those in the pre-DAA era. Graft survival improved for all recipients in the DAA era but improved most dramatically in HCV-positive recipients: D–/R+ 1-year survival was 92.4{\%} versus 88.7{\%} and 3-year survival was 83.7{\%} versus 77.7{\%} (DAA versus pre-DAA era, respectively) compared with D–/R– 1-year survival of 92.7{\%} versus 91.0{\%} and 3-year survival of 85.7{\%} versus 84.0{\%} (DAA versus pre-DAA era, respectively). The magnitude of improvement in 3-year graft survival was almost 4-fold greater for D–/R+ patients. The 3-year survival for D+/R+ patients was similar to HCV-negative patients. In conclusion, the number of liver transplants for HCV has decreased by more than one-third over the past decade. Graft survival among HCV-positive recipients has increased disproportionately in the DAA era with HCV-positive recipients now achieving similar outcomes to non-HCV recipients.},

The incidence of fistula was 12.5 per cent. This paper could not verify reports that any specific factors were significantly related to fistula formation, although there was a preponderance of fistulas in patients presenting with late stage tumours. No relationship was found with rate of infection, age, or between previous neck irradiation (ranging from 5500 to 7000 cGy) and fistula formation in the patient population. If a fistula occurs, the administration of oral solid food keeping the nasogastric tube in place for administration of fluids may lead to spontaneous closure of the fistula, with no need for secondary surgical repair.},

abstract = {Background Outcome after liver transplantation (LT) is determined by donor, transplant and recipient risk factors. These factors may have different impact on either patient or graft survival (outcome type). In the literature, there is wide variation in the use of outcome types and points in time (short term or long term). Objective of this study is to analyze the predictive capacity of risk factors and risk models in LT and how they vary over time and per outcome type. Methods All LTs performed in the Netherlands from January 1, 2002, to December 31, 2011, were analyzed with multivariate analyses at 3-month, 1-year, and 5-year for patient and (non-)death-censored graft survival. The predictive capacity of the investigated risk models was compared with concordance indices. Results Recipient age, model for end-stage liver disease sodium, ventilatory support, diabetes mellitus, hepatocellular carcinoma, previous malignancy, hepatitis C virus antibody, hepatitis B virus antibody, perfusion fluid, and Eurotransplant donor risk index (ET-DRI) had significant impact on outcome (graft or patient survival) at 1 or multiple points in time. Significant factors at 3-month patient survival (recipient age, model for end-stage liver disease sodium, ventilatory support) were used to compose a concept model. This model, had a higher c-index than the balance-of-risk score, DRI, ET-DRI, donor-recipient model and simplified recipient risk index for long-term patient and non-death-censored graft survival. Conclusions In this study, the effects of recipient risk factors and models on different outcome types and time points were shown. Short-term patient survival mainly depends on recipient risk factors, long-term graft survival on donor risk factors and is more difficult to predict. Next to the concept model, the donor-recipient model has a higher predictive capacity to other risk models for (long-term) patient and non-death-censored graft survival. The DRI and ET-DRI best predicted death-censored graft survival. Knowledge about risk factors and models is critical when using these for waitlist management and/or help in organ allocation and decision-making.},

In May 1973, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) began a Phase III study of preoperative radiation therapy (50.0 Gy) versus postoperative radiation therapy (60.0 Gy) for supraglottic larynx and hypopharynx primaries. Of 277 evaluable patients, duration of follow-up is 9-15 years, with 7.6{\%} patients lost to follow-up before 7 years. Loco-regional control was significantly better for 141 postoperative radiation therapy patients than for 136 preoperative radiation therapy patients (p = 0.04), but absolute survival was not affected (p = 0.15). When the analysis was restricted to supraglottic larynx primaries (60 postoperative radiation therapy patients versus 58 preoperative radiation therapy patients), the difference for loco-regional control was highly significant (p = .007), but not for survival (p = 0.18). In considering only supraglottic larynx, 78{\%} of loco-regional failures occurred in the first 2 years. Thirty-one percent (18/58) of preoperative patients failed locally within 2 years versus 18{\%} (11/60) of postoperative patients. After 2 years, distant metastases and second primaries became the predominant failure pattern, especially in postoperative radiation therapy patients. This shift in the late failure pattern along with the increased number of unrelated deaths negated any advantage in absolute survival for postoperative radiation therapy patients. The rates of severe surgical and radiation therapy complications were similar between the two arms. Because of an increased incidence of late distant metastases and secondary primaries, additional therapeutic intervention is required beyond surgery and postoperative irradiation to impact significantly upon survival.},

abstract = {Purpose of this review is to systematically assess the effects on voice and speech of advanced head and neck cancer and its treatment by means of chemoradiotherapy (CRT). The databases Medline, Embase and Cochrane were searched (1991-2009) for terms head and neck cancer, chemoradiation, voice and speech rehabilitation. Twenty articles met the inclusion criteria, whereof 14 reported on voice outcomes and 10 on speech. Within the selected 20 studies, 18 different tools were used for speech or voice evaluation. Most studies assessed their data by means of patient questionnaires. Four studies presented outcome measures in more than one dimension. Most studies summarised the outcomes of posttreatment data that were assessed at various points in time after treatment. Except for four studies, pre-treatment measurements were lacking. This and the fact that most studies combined the outcomes of patients with radiated laryngeal cancers with outcome data of non-laryngeal cancer patients impedes an interpretation in terms of the effects of radiation versus the effects of the disease itself on voice or speech. Overall, the studies indicated that voice and speech degenerated during CRT, improved again 1-2 months after treatment and exceeded pre-treatment levels after 1 year or longer. However, voice and speech measures do not show normal values before or after treatment. Given the large-ranged posttreatment data, missing baseline assessment and the lacking separation of tumour/radiation sites, there is an urgent need for structured standardised multi-dimensional speech and voice assessment protocols in patients with advanced head and neck cancer treated with CRT.},

Fibrinogen is critical in maintaining primary and secondary hemostasis. Therefore, we prospectively analyzed the association between fibrinogen and outcomes in AoCLF patients. Plasma fibrinogen was measured in 169 AoCLF, 173 chronic hepatitis B (CHB), and 171 healthy patients using a coagulation method. The predictive ability of fibrinogen for 3-month mortality in AoCLF patients was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and multivariable logistic regression analyses. Plasma fibrinogen was significantly lower in nonsurvivor AoCLF patients compared with survivor AoCLF, CHB, and control patients. The sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve of 1/fibrinogen predicting mortality in AoCLF patients were 66.7{\%}, 72.5{\%}, and 0.746 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.672–0.820, P {\textless} 0.001 ), and the fibrinogen cutoff value was 0.90 g/L. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, low fibrinogen was an independent factor predicting mortality (odds ratio: 0.304; 95{\%} CI: 0.094–0.983; P = 0.047 ). Nonsurvivor AoCLF patients had significantly decreased fibrinogen levels, suggesting that low plasma fibrinogen may be a useful predictor of poor prognosis in AoCLF patients.},

abstract = {Treatments are frequently evaluated in terms of their effect on patient survival. In settings where randomization of treatment is not feasible, observational data are employed, necessitating correction for covariate imbalances. Treatments are usually compared using a hazard ratio. Most existing methods which quantify the treatment effect through the survival function are applicable to treatments assigned at time 0. In the data structure of our interest, subjects typically begin follow-up untreated; time-until-treatment, and the pretreatment death hazard are both heavily influenced by longitudinal covariates; and subjects may experience periods of treatment ineligibility. We propose semiparametric methods for estimating the average difference in restricted mean survival time attributable to a time-dependent treatment, the average effect of treatment among the treated, under current treatment assignment patterns. The pre- and posttreatment models are partly conditional, in that they use the covariate history up to the time of treatment. The pre-treatment model is estimated through recently developed landmark analysis methods. For each treated patient, fitted pre- and posttreatment survival curves are projected out, then averaged in a manner which accounts for the censoring of treatment times. Asymptotic properties are derived and evaluated through simulation. The proposed methods are applied to liver transplant data in order to estimate the effect of liver transplantation on survival among transplant recipients under current practice patterns.},

A total of 40 patients with unilateral paralysis underwent type I thyroplasty with or without arytenoid adduction. Perceptual, acoustic and aerodynamic measures of voice were studied. Perceptual analysis determined that optimal postoperative voice quality evolved over the first year. Acoustic indices of perturbation demonstrated progressive improvement over 12 months, whereas pitch and intensity ranges were increasingly extended. Postoperative glottal flow rates were normalized and phonation times were significantly longer, with benefits maintained over time. All perceptual, aerodynamic and acoustic measures of voice were improved 3 months after thyroplasty, with many measures further improved at 1 year. Such findings provide evidence that voice outcome progressively evolves over the first 12 months after surgery.},

Carbon dioxide (CO2) laser cordectomy is considered one of the modalities of choice for treatment of early glottic carcinoma. In addition to its comparable oncological results with radiotherapy and open surgical procedures, it preserves of laryngeal functions including voice production. The aim of this study was to detect how the larynx compensates for voice production after different types of CO2 laser cordectomy for early glottic carcinoma together with assessment of the vocal outcome in each compensation mechanism. Methods. One hundred twelve patients treated with CO2 laser cordectomy were classified according to their main postoperative phonatory site. Perceptual analysis of voice samples using GRBAS (grade, roughness, breathiness, asthenia, and strain) scale was done for 88 patients after exclusion of the voice samples of all female patients to make the study population homogenous and the samples of 18 male patients due to bad quality (4 patients) or unavailability (14 patients) of their voice samples and the results were compared with those obtained from control group that included 25 age-matched euphonic male subjects. Results. Five types of laryngeal compensation were defined including: vocal fold to vocal fold, vocal fold to vocal neofold, vocal fold to vestibular fold, vestibular fold, to vestibular fold, and arytenoids hyper adduction. Characters changes of voice produced by each compensation type were found to be statistically significant except for breathiness, asthenia and strain changes in vocal fold to vocal fold compensation type. Conclusion. The larynx can compensate for voice production after CO2 laser cordectomy by five different compensation mechanisms with none of them producing voice quality comparable with that of controls.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) allocation system for liver transplantation (LT) may present a disadvantage for women by including serum creatinine, which is typically lower in females. Our objectives were to investigate gender disparities in outcomes among LT candidates and to assess a revised MELD, including estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), for predicting waiting list mortality. Methods: Adults registered for LT between 2002 and 2007 were identified using the UNOS database. We compared components of MELD, MDRD-derived eGFR, and the 3-month probability of LT and death between genders. Discrimination of MELD, MELDNa, and revised models including eGFR for mortality were compared using c-statistics. Results: A total of 40,393 patients (36{\%} female) met the inclusion criteria; 9{\%} died and 24{\%} underwent LT within 3 months of listing. Compared with men, women had lower median serum creatinine (0.9 vs. 1.0 mg/dl), eGFR (72 vs. 83 ml/min/1.73 m 2), and mean MELD (16.5 vs. 17.2; all p {\textless}0.0005), but within most MELD strata, had higher bilirubin and INR. After adjusting for relevant covariates including creatinine and body weight, women were less likely than men to receive a LT (hazard ratio [HR] 0.85; 95{\%} CI 0.79-0.87) and had greater 3-month mortality (HR 1.13; 95{\%} CI 1.05-1.21). Revision of MELD and MELDNa to include eGFR did not improve discrimination for 3-month mortality (c-statistics: MELD 0.896, MELD-eGFR 0.894, MELDNa 0.911, MELDNa-eGFR 0.905). Conclusions: Women are disadvantaged under MELD potentially due to its inclusion of creatinine. However, since including eGFR in MELD does not improve mortality prediction, alternative refinements are necessary. {\textcopyright} 2010 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims Number-needed-to-treat is used in assessing the effectiveness of a health-care intervention, and reports the number of patients who need to be treated to prevent one additional bad outcome. Although largely used in medical literature, there are no studies measuring the benefit of liver transplantation (LT) over hepatic resection (HR) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in terms of "Number of patients needed to transplant (NTT)." Methods Exclusion criteria: Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) Classes B-C, very large ({\textgreater}10 cm) and multi-nodular ({\textgreater}2 nodules) tumours, macroscopic vascular invasion and extra-hepatic metastases. Study population: 1028 HCC cirrhotic patients from one Eastern (n = 441) and two Western (n = 587) surgical units. Patient survival observed after HR by proportional hazard regression model was compared to that predicted after LT by the Metroticket calculator. The benefit obtainable from LT compared to resection was analysed in relationship with number of nodules (modelled as ordinal variable: single vs. oligonodular), size of largest nodule (modelled as a continuous variable), presence of microscopic vascular invasion (MVI), and time horizon from surgery (5-year vs. 10-year). Results 330 patients were beyond the Milan criteria (32{\%}) and 597 (58{\%}) had MVI. The prevalence of MVI was 52{\%} in patients within Milan criteria and 71{\%} in those beyond (p {\textless}0.0001). In the 5-year transplant benefit analysis, nodule size and HCC number were positive predictors of transplant benefit, while MVI had a strong negative impact on NTT. Transplantation performed as an effective therapy (NTT {\textless}5) only in oligonodular HCC with largest diameter {\textgreater}3 cm (beyond conventional LT criteria) when MVI was absent. The 10-year scenario increased drastically the transplant benefit in all subgroups of resectable patients, and LT became an effective therapy (NTT {\textless}5) for all patients without MVI whenever tumor extension and for oligonodular HCC with MVI within conventional LT criteria. Conclusions Based on NTT analysis, the adopted time horizon (5-year vs. 10-year scenario) is the main factor influencing the benefit of LT in patients with resectable HCC and Child A cirrhosis. {\textcopyright} 2014 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Total laryngectomy is a recognised treatment for advanced laryngeal carcinoma. Traditionally, pharyngeal repair is performed with layered sutures. We describe our experience with a technique of closed pharyngoplasty using a linear stapler device. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten total laryngectomies were performed from July 2002 to July 2004, using an Ethicon TLC 75 linear stapler for pharyngeal closure. Data collected included age, sex, staging, endoscopic assessment, surgical margins and post-operative course (including complications and swallowing). RESULTS: Patients comprised eight men and two women. The mean age was 55.4 years. Six patients had stage T4 endolaryngeal carcinoma and four had stage T3. Four patients underwent pre-operative radiotherapy. Clear surgical margins were achieved in all patients. One patient developed a pharyngocutaneous fistula. Patients resumed oral intake at 48 hours, or at 72 hours if they had undergone pre-operative radiotherapy. Patients' mean hospital stay was seven days. CONCLUSION: This stapled closed technique for pharyngoplasty is efficient and eliminates the risk of wound contamination, thus theoretically reducing the risk of tumour seeding. In addition, we were able to commence patients on oral fluids at a mean of 48 hours after surgery. The mean hospital stay was seven days. We recommend this technique as an alternative for repairing the pharynx in patients undergoing total laryngectomy for endolaryngeal carcinoma.},

abstract = {Objectives: Increasing incidence of laryngeal carcinoma and advancement in diagnostics and therapy methods, have led to constant exploration in that field. Early glottic carcinoma can be treated successfully with several procedures: cordectomy through laryngofissure, laser cordectomy, and radiotherapy. Our objective was to assess the voice quality after these different modalities of treatment. Study Design: Prospective controlled study with 69 patients, treated in a 1-year period for glottic Tis and T1a carcinoma at the tertiary medical centre. Methods: Nineteen of our patients were treated endoscopically with CO 2 laser (types III-IV cordectomy according to recommended European Laryngological Society classification of endoscopic cordectomies). Thirty-five patients underwent cordectomy through laryngofissure, 15 patients had radiotherapy. Multidimensional computer analysis of voice and speech was conducted 1, 6, and 12 months after the treatment. Three programs included 14 parameters, which were observed. Results: While comparing the parameters between the groups, there were significant differences in the values of fundamental frequency (Hz), jitter ({\%}), normalized noise energy (dB), standard deviation of fundamental frequency (Hz), percent silent time ({\%}), and sound-pressure level in the different follow-up periods (P {\textless} 0.05). Conclusion: In the long run, patients treated with radiotherapy show better voice quality in comparison with other two groups. ?? 2012 The Voice Foundation.},

abstract = {Infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes varicella (chickenpox), which can be severe in immunocompromised individuals, infants and adults. Primary infection is followed by latency in ganglionic neurons. During this period, no virus particles are produced and no obvious neuronal damage occurs. Reactivation of the virus leads to virus replication, which causes zoster (shingles) in tissues innervated by the involved neurons, inflammation and cell death - a process that can lead to persistent radicular pain (postherpetic neuralgia). The pathogenesis of postherpetic neuralgia is unknown and it is difficult to treat. Furthermore, other zoster complications can develop, including myelitis, cranial nerve palsies, meningitis, stroke (vasculopathy), retinitis, and gastroenterological infections such as ulcers, pancreatitis and hepatitis. VZV is the only human herpesvirus for which highly effective vaccines are available. After varicella or vaccination, both wild-type and vaccine-type VZV establish latency, and long-term immunity to varicella develops. However, immunity does not protect against reactivation. Thus, two vaccines are used: one to prevent varicella and one to prevent zoster. In this Primer we discuss the pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of VZV infections, with an emphasis on the molecular events that regulate these diseases.

In 1998, the Health Resources and Services Administration of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services published the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Final Rule. Under the rule, which became effective in 2000, the OPTN had to demonstrate that existing allocation policies met certain conditions or change the policies to meet a range of criteria, including broader geographic sharing of organs, reducing the use of waiting time as an allocation criterion and creating equitable organ allocation systems using objective medical criteria and medical urgency to allocate donor organs for transplant. This mandate resulted in reviews of all organ allocation policies, and led to the creation of the Lung Allocation Subcommittee of the OPTN Thoracic Organ Transplantation Committee. This paper reviews the deliberations of the Subcommittee in identifying priorities for a new lung allocation system, the analyses undertaken by the OPTN and the Scientific Registry for Transplant Recipients and the evolution of a new lung allocation system that ranks candidates for lungs based on a Lung Allocation Score, incorporating waiting list and posttransplant survival probabilities.},

abstract = {Purpose: A multi-institutional, prospective, randomized trial was undertaken in patients with advanced head- and-neck squamous cell carcinoma to address (1) the validity of using pathologic risk features, established from a previous study, to determine the need for, and dose of, postoperative radiotherapy (PORT); (2) the impact of accelerating PORT using a concomitant boost schedule; and (3) the importance of the overall combined treatment duration on the treatment outcome. Methods and Materials: Of 288 consecutive patients with advanced disease registered preoperatively, 213 fulfilled the trial criteria and went on to receive therapy predicated on a set of pathologic risk features: no PORT for the low-risk group (n ? 31); 57.6 Gy during 6.5 weeks for the intermediate-risk group (n ? 31); and, by random assignment, 63 Gy during 5 weeks (n ? 76) or 7 weeks (n ? 75) for the high-risk group. Patients were irradiated with standard techniques appropriate to the site of disease and likely areas of spread. The study end points were locoregional control (LRC), survival, and morbidity. Results: Patients with low or intermediate risks had significantly higher LRC and survival rates than those with high-risk features (p ? 0.003 and p ? 0.0001, respectively), despite receiving no PORT or lower dose PORT, respectively. For high-risk patients, a trend toward higher LRC and survival rates was noted when PORT was delivered in 5 rather than 7 weeks. A prolonged interval between surgery and PORT in the 7-week schedule was associated with significantly lower LRC (p ? 0.03) and survival (p ? 0.01) rates. Consequently, the cumulative duration of combined therapy had a significant impact on the LRC (p ? 0.005) and survival (p ? 0.03) rates. A 2-week reduction in the PORT duration by using the concomitant boost technique did not increase the late treatment toxicity. Conclusions: This Phase III trial established the power of risk assessment using pathologic features in deter- mining the need for, and dose of, PORT in patients with advanced head-and-neck squamous cell cancer in a prospective, multi-institutional setting. It also revealed the impact of the overall treatment time in the combi- nation of surgery and PORT on the outcome in high-risk patients and showed that PORT acceleration without a reduction in dose by a concomitant boost regimen did not increase the late complication rate. These findings emphasize the importance of coordinated interdisciplinary care in the delivery of combined surgery and RT. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Inc},

The vocal folds of ten human fresh excised larynges were medialized by TPI on one side and by rotation of the arytenoid on the contralateral side. Laryngeal vibration was artificially produced and was recorded by videostroboscopy. The images were subjectively and objectively analyzed. Subjective analysis included periodicity of vibratory cycles, features of the mucosal wave present on the TPI side, amplitude of vibration, and profile of free border of each vocal fold during the opening phase. Objective analyses were carried out on frame-by-frame digitalized images to determine amplitudes of vibrations and phase differences between the folds in three glottic regions (anterior, middle, and posterior). Subjective analysis revealed regular periodicity in 100{\%} of the larynges, a decrease in the mucosal wave on the TPI side in 70{\%}, reduction in amplitude in 30{\%}, and a sigmoid profile of the free border on the TPI side in 80{\%}. Objective analysis showed mean amplitude in the posterior glottic region on the TPI side significantly larger than that on the arytenoids rotation side and phase asymmetry in 90{\%} of the larynges.},

abstract = {Objectives/Hypothesis: The aim of this study was to assess whether the use of the temporoparietal fascia as a free flap for pharyngeal closure reinforcement reduced the incidence of pharyngocutaneous fistula (PCF) in the salvage setting. Study Design: Consecutive case series. Methods: After research ethics board approval, 12 patients who required salvage laryngectomy, including reinforcement coverage of the primarily closed pharyngeal defect with temporoparietal fascia as a free tissue transfer, were analyzed. Results: One (8{\%}) out of 12 patients experienced pharyngocutaneous fistula that responded with conservative wound packing. Conclusions: The PCF rate of 8{\%} is significantly better than in similar salvage cases without flap coverage. Moreover, our PCF rate is comparable to the results shown for the pectoralis major muscle flap. The most obvious benefit of the temporoparietal fascia free flap for pharyngeal coverage in salvage laryngectomy is a reduced PCF rate with diminished donor-site morbidity, including cosmetic outcome, shoulder girdle function, and chest deformity.

abstract = {The first human liver transplant operation was performed by Thomas Starzl in 1963. The next two decades were marked by difficulties with donor organ quality, recipient selection, operative and perioperative management, immunosuppression and infectious complications. Advances in each of these areas transformed liver transplantation from an experimental procedure to a standard treatment for end-stage liver disease and certain cancers. From the handful of pioneering programmes, liver transplantation has expanded to hundreds of programmes in {\textgreater}80 countries. 1-year patient survival rates have exceeded 80{\%} and outcomes continue to improve. This success has created obstacles. Ongoing challenges of liver transplantation include those concerning donor organ shortages, recipients with more advanced disease at transplant, growing need for retransplantation, toxicities and adverse effects associated with long-term immunosuppression, obesity and NASH epidemics, HCV recurrence and the still inscrutable biology of hepatocellular carcinoma. This Perspectives summarizes this transformation over time and details some of the challenges ahead. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {AbstractBackground {\&} Aims  Liver transplant priority in the US and Europe follows the ‘sickest-first 'principle. However, for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), priority is based on binary tumor criteria (e.g., Milan) to expedite transplant for patients with ‘acceptable' post-transplant outcomes. Newer risk scores developed to overcome limitations of these binary criteria (e.g., Metroticket, HALT-HCC) are insufficient to be used for waitlist priority as they focus solely on HCC-related pre-transplant variables. We sought to develop a risk score to predict post-transplant survival for HCC patients using HCC- and non-HCC related variables.  Methods  Retrospective cohort study using national registry data of adult deceased-donor liver transplant (DDLT) recipients with HCC from 2/27/02-12/31/18. We fit Cox regression models focused on 5- and 10-year survival to estimate beta coefficients for a risk score using manual variable selection and calculated absolute predicted survival time and compared it to available risk scores.  Results  Among 6,502 adult HCC LT recipients, 11 variables were selected in the final model. The AUC's at 5- and 10-years were: 0.62, 95{\%} CI: 0.57-0.67 and 0.65, 95{\%} CI: 0.58-0.72, which was not statistically significantly different than the Metroticket and HALT-HCC scores. The LiTES-HCC score was able to discriminate patients based on post-transplant survival among those meeting Milan and UCSF.  Conclusion  We developed and validated a risk score to predict post-transplant survival for patients HCC. By including HCC- and non-HCC related variables (e.g., age, chronic kidney disease), this score could allow transplant professionals to prioritize patients with HCC in terms of predicted survival. In the future, this score could be integrated into survival benefit-based models to lead to meaningful improvements in life-years at the population-level.  Lay summary  We created a risk score to predict how long patients with liver cancer will live if they get a liver transplant. In the future, this could be used to decide which waitlisted patients should get the next transplant.},

abstract = {Personal experience in performing linear stapler closure of the pharynx during 70 total laryngectomies is reported. Laryngeal staplers (55 and 60 cm) with an angled handle were used, permitting vertical closure with 19 or 20 metal staples in a double row. A closed technique was initially used, but, over the years, this has gradually been replaced by the semi-closed technique to avoid trapping the suprahyoid part of the epiglottis between the jaws of the stapler. The stapler is inserted below the larynx after having separated it from all muscular and neurovascular connections, and after performing a mini-pharyngotomy at the vallecula epiglottica in order to extract the epiglottis, evert it ventrally and suture it to the hyothyroepiglottic space. The jaws of the stapler are closed and the staples are fired while the flaps of the mini-pharyngotomy are raised above the jaws. The scalpel is inserted above the stapler to remove the larynx. When the stapler is opened, the vertical linear suture of the pharynx is evident and can be examined. This procedure takes only a few minutes to perform. It guarantees a long-term stable watertight closure, dramatically reduces contamination of the operating field by pharyngeal secretions, and permits rapid healing time, greatly lowering patient management costs. In the cases presented here, there was a 1.8{\%} rate of pharyngocutaneous fistulae in patients who were not radiated, whereas the rate was 13.1{\%} in pre-radiated patients. In agreement with the international literature, this procedure does not increase the rate of fistulae and, in fact, it seems to reduce it. Moreover, it is particularly indicated for pre-radiated patients. Nevertheless, the Authors recommend reserving this type of procedure to cases in which, based on meticulous pre-operative assessment by means of endoscopy and imaging, the endolaryngeal site of the tumour has been assessed and there is no need for peri-operative exploration of the pharynx or tongue base.},

This article surveys the R package pec which provides a set of functions for efficient computation of prediction error curves. The software implements inverse probability of censoring weights to deal with right censored data and several variants of cross-validation to deal with the apparent error problem. In principle, all kinds of prediction models can be assessed, and the package readily supports most traditional regression modeling strategies, like Cox regression or additive hazard regression, as well as state of the art machine learning methods such as random forests, a nonparametric method which provides promising alternatives to traditional strategies in low and high-dimensional settings. We show how the functionality of pec can be extended to yet unsupported prediction models. As an example, we implement support for random forest prediction models based on the R-packages randomSurvivalForest and party. Using data of the Copenhagen Stroke Study we use pec to compare random forests to a Cox regression model derived from stepwise variable selection. Reproducible results on the user level are given for publicly available data from the German breast cancer study group.},

abstract = {Several epidemiological studies have shown a positive association between adult height and cancer incidence. The only study conducted among women on mouth and pharynx cancer risk, however, reported an inverse association. This study aims to investigate the association between height and the risk of head and neck cancer (HNC) within a large international consortium of HNC. We analyzed pooled individual-level data from 24 case-control studies participating in the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology Consortium. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated separately for men and women for associations between height and HNC risk. Educational level, tobacco smoking, and alcohol consumption were included in all regression models. Stratified analyses by HNC subsites were performed. This project included 17,666 cases and 28,198 controls. We found an inverse association between height and HNC (adjusted OR per 10 cm height = 0.91; 95{\%} CI 5 0.86-0.95 for men; adjusted OR = 0.86; 95{\%} CI 5 0.79-0.93 for women). In men, the estimated OR did vary by educational level, smoking status, geographic area, and control source. No differences by subsites were detected. Adult height is inversely associated with HNC risk. As height can be considered a marker of childhood illness and low energy intake, the inverse association is consistent with prior studies showing that HNC occur more frequently among deprived individuals. Further studies designed to elucidate the mechanism of such association would be warranted.},

We consecutively executed two double-blind randomized trials in patients with CT-proven brain metastasis and Karnofsky scores of 80 or less. In the first series, we compared 8 mg dexamethasone per day versus 16 mg/d; in the second series, 4 mg/d versus 16 mg/d. Standardized evaluation of quality of life and side effects took place at days 0, 7, 28, and 56. We randomized a total of 96 patients and evaluated eighty-nine. The Karnofsky score improved in the 8-mg group, which had improvement of 8.0 +/- 10.1 (mean +/- SD) points at day 7 versus 7.3 +/- 14.2 points in the 16-mg group. In the second series, the 4-mg group had improvement of 6.7 +/- 11.3 points at day 7 and 7.1 +/- 18.2 points at day 28 versus 9.1 +/- 12.4 and 5.6 +/- 18.5 points in the 16-mg group. Toxic effects occurred more frequently in the 16-mg group (p {\textless} 0.03). We conclude that administration of 4 mg dexamethasone per day for treatment of brain tumor edema results in the same degree of improvement as does administration of 16 mg/d after 1 week of treatment in patients who have no signs of impending herniation. Toxic effects are dose-dependent and, during a 4-week period, occurred more frequently in patients using 16 mg/d.},

Methods: Twenty patients with glottic incompetence (GI) and mobile vocal folds were retrospectively analyzed after gore-tex medialization laryngoplasty. Pre- and postoperative outcome measures including grade, roughness, breathiness, asthenia, strain of the voice (GRBAS), glottal function index (GFI), and voice-related quality of life (VRQOL) were compared to detect surgical effectiveness. Two anesthetic subgroups were identified and compared: general anesthesia, via laryngeal mask airway (LMA) anesthetic, and local anesthesia. Results: Statistically significant differences were identified between pre- and postoperative VRQOL (P {\textless} 0.0001), GFI (P {\textless} 0.01), and composite GRBAS (P {\textless} 0.0001) after a mean follow-up time of 7.8 months. Both the LMA and the local anesthetic subgroups demonstrated similar significance across these measures. GFI and VRQOL scores demonstrate a moderate correlation (?? = 0.71). Perceptual voice quality (GRBAS) correlates slightly better with VRQOL scores (?? = -0.6; P {\textless} 0.01) than qualitative measures of glottal function (GFI) (?? = 0.43).

abstract = {To survey the burden of liver disease in Europe and its causes 260 epidemiological studies published in the last five years were reviewed. The incidence and prevalence of cirrhosis and primary liver cancer are key to understand the burden of liver disease. They represent the end-stage of liver pathology and thus are indicative of the associated mortality. About 0.1{\%} of Hungarian males will die of cirrhosis every year compared with 0.001{\%} of Greek females. WHO estimate that liver cancer is responsible for around 47,000 deaths per year in the EU. Harmful alcohol consumption, viral hepatitis B and C and metabolic syndromes related to overweight and obesity are the leading causes of cirrhosis and primary liver cancer in Europe. Chronic hepatitis B affects 0.5-0.7{\%} of the European population. In the last decade the prevalence of chronic hepatitis C was 0.13-3.26{\%}. It is of great concern that about 90{\%} of people in Europe infected by viral hepatitis are unaware of their status. Available data suggest the prevalence rate of NAFLD is 2-44{\%} in the general European population (including obese children) and 42.6-69.5{\%} in people with type 2 diabetes. Each of these four major causes of liver disease is amenable to prevention and treatment, reducing the burden of liver disease in Europe and saving lives. Further surveys are urgently needed to implement cost-effective prevention programmes and novel treatments to tackle this problem.},

abstract = {Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) may worsen liver function and decrease survival in some patients. The Child-Pugh classification has several drawbacks when used to determine survival in such patients. The survival of 231 patients at 4 medical centers within the United States who underwent elective TIPS was studied to develop statistical models to (1) predict patient survival and (2) identify those patients whose liver- related mortality post-TIPS would be 3 months or less. Among these elective TIPS patients, 173 had the procedure for prevention of variceal rebleeding and 58 for treatment of refractory ascites. Death related to liver disease occurred in 110 patients, 70 within 3 months. Cox proportional-hazards regression identified serum concentrations of bilirubin and creatinine, international normalized ratio for prothrombin time (INR), and the cause of the underlying liver disease as predictors of survival in patients undergoing elective TIPS, either for prevention of variceal rebleeding or for treatment of refractory ascites. These variables can be used to calculate a risk score (R) for patients undergoing elective TIPS. Patients with R {\textgreater} 1.8 had a median survival of 3 months or less. This model was superior to both the Child-Pugh classification, as well as the Child-Pugh score, in predicting survival. Using logistic regression and the same variables, we also developed a nomogram that indicates which patients survive less than 3 months. Finally, the model was validated among an independent set of 71 patients from the Netherlands. This Mayo TIPS model may predict early death following elective TIPS for either prevention of variceal rebleeding or for treatment of refractory ascites.},

abstract = {In this study, we investigated the prognostic value of serum sodium and hyponatremia (≤130 mEq/L) in 262 cirrhotic patients consecutively listed, 19 of which died (7{\%}), 175 survived (67{\%}), and 68 underwent liver transplantation (26{\%}) during 3 months of follow-up. Hyponatremia was present in 63{\%} of patients who died, compared to 13{\%} of those who survived (P  {\textless}  .001), whereas the proportion with elevated creatinine (≥1.4 mg/dL) was low and similar in both groups (10.5 vs. 3{\%}). Prevalence of hyponatremia was higher than that of elevated serum creatinine across all model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) categories. Using logistic regression, hyponatremia and serum sodium were significant predictors of mortality with concordance statistics (c-statistics) .753 for hyponatremia, .784 for sodium, .894 for MELD, .905 for MELD plus hyponatremia (P = .006 vs. MELD alone), and .908 for MELD plus serum sodium (P = .026 vs. MELD alone). Risk of death across all MELD scores was higher for patients with hyponatremia than without hyponatremia. Cox regression considering data within 6 months of follow-up yielded qualitatively similar results, with hyponatremia being a significant predictor of greater mortality risk with an odds ratio of 2.65 (P = .015). Each increase of 1 mEq/L of serum sodium level was associated with a decreased odds ratio of .95 (P = .048). Our results indicate that hyponatremia appears to be an earlier and more sensitive marker than serum creatinine to detect renal impairment and/or circulatory dysfunction in patients with advanced cirrhosis. In conclusion, addition of serum sodium to MELD identified a subgroup of patients with poor outcome in a more efficient way than MELD alone and significantly increased the efficacy of the score to predict waitlist mortality.

Pharyngocutaneous fistulae occurred in 84 cases (23 per cent). There was no difference between the fistula group and the non-fistula group with regard to age, sex, general condition, or tumour differentiation. The only significant, positive association was with previous radical radiotherapy (10 fistulae out of 167 primary laryngectomies (4 per cent) versus 74 fistulae out of 190 salvage laryngectomies (39 per cent)). The median time to occurrence of a fistula was day seven in both groups. However, in the non-radiotherapy group the median duration of the fistula was 28 days; the majority healing spontaneously, with only one patient requiring surgical closure. There were no 'hospital' deaths. In the radiotherapy group the median duration of fistulae was 112 days with 30 patients requiring a total of 66 procedures to achieve closure of the fistula. There were six 'hospital' deaths in this group. We conclude that previous radical radiotherapy strongly predisposes towards the occurrence of a post-laryngectomy fistula. Fistulae in this group tend to be longer lasting and are more likely to require surgical repair.},

abstract = {It is critical to balance waitlist mortality against posttransplant mortality. Our objective was to devise a scoring system that predicts recipient survival at 3 months following liver transplantation to complement MELD-predicted waitlist mortality. Univariate and multivariate analysis on 21,673 liver transplant recipients identified independent recipient and donor risk factors for posttransplant mortality. A retrospective analysis conducted on 30,321 waitlisted candidates reevaluated the predictive ability of the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. We identified 13 recipient factors, 4 donor factors and 2 operative factors (warm and cold ischemia) as significant predictors of recipient mortality following liver transplantation at 3 months. The Survival Outcomes Following Liver Transplant (SOFT) Score utilized 18 risk factors (excluding warm ischemia) to successfully predict 3-month recipient survival following liver transplantation. This analysis represents a study of waitlisted candidates and transplant recipients of liver allografts after the MELD score was implemented. Unlike MELD, the SOFT score can accurately predict 3-month survival following liver transplantation. The most significant risk factors were previous transplantation and life support pretransplant. The SOFT score can help clinicians determine in real time which candidates should be transplanted with which allografts. Combined with MELD, SOFT can better quantify survival benefit for individual transplant procedures.},

abstract = {Introduction: We examine the complication after total laryngectomy. We previously reported that it was possible to render no complication after laryngeal surgery of the patients with radiation failure using PGE1 at peri-operative period. Here we report the evaluation of the differences of the frequencies of complications between patients with radiation failure and those without it. Patients and methods: This study is a retrospective chart review of 37 patients who underwent total laryngectomy in our hospital from 2001 to 2008. These included 24 patients who underwent surgery for primary treatment and 12 patients who underwent salvage surgery due to radiation failure. The other one patient had a laryngopharyngeal stenosis after radiation therapy for hypopharyngeal cancer and underwent total laryngectomy as a salvage surgery. There were one, 9, 14 cases of T2, T3, T4 tumors, respectively who underwent surgery for primary treatment and were 2, 5, 5 cases of T2, T3, T4 tumors, respectively who underwent salvage surgery. Closure of the hypopharyngeal mucosa was performed using 4-0 silk and no other procedures were conducted to reinforce the wound. Results: As for 24 patients of primary treatment, a minor leakage and a pharyngocutaneous fistula were observed in two patients who had active diabetes mellitus and their beginning of per os intake were 17th POD and 34th POD, respectively. Their days of discharge were also prolonged to 30th POD and 50th POD, respectively. One patient had a subcutaneous abscess around the tracheostoma and his beginning of per os intake and day of discharge were prolonged to 13th POD and 28th POD. Another patient also had a subcutaneous abscess and his day of discharge was prolonged to 36th POD. Average days of beginning of per os intake from surgery were 9.1 days and average days of discharge from surgery were 23.3 days. On the other hand, 13 patients who underwent salvage surgery had no leakage or other wound complication and average days of discharge after surgery were 20.8 days. Conclusions: According to our protocols for laryngectomy, by using PGE1 administration during peri-operative period, even patients with radiation failure had no wound complication and could discharge in relatively short hospital stay. As diabetes mellitus seemed to be a key factor for wound complication after laryngectomy even if they were patients for primary treatment, we must consider a new method for treat them.},

Thirty-eight liver transplant centers served a population of about 135 million in 2015. Around 1600 deceased donor livers are transplanted annually. The number of deceased organ donors remains stable but donor age is increasing. Nevertheless, liver utilization rates are unchanged at around 80{\%}. Donation after circulatory determination of death (DCD) increased fourfold in the past decade. In Belgium and the Netherlands, DCDs were responsible for 30{\%} of deceased donor liver transplant activity in 2015; Austria only occasionally transplants a DCD liver; other Eurotransplant countries do not have active DCD programs. The most frequent indications for liver transplantation are alcoholic liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and viral hepatitis. Livers are allocated first internationally to high urgency status patients or those with an approved combined organ status (for a liver in combination with heart, lung, intestine, or pancreas) and then on a national basis where allocation is recipient-driven or center-driven, depending on country-specific rules. Median waiting time for an elective liver transplant was 4,4 months in 2015; high ur-gency status patients waited a median of 2 days for a suitable liver. Mortality on the waiting list was 18{\%} in 2015, 4{\%} of patients were delisted because they became unfit for transplantation.

Cox regression models identified seven donor characteristics that independently predicted significantly increased risk of graft failure. Donor age over 40 years (and particularly over 60 years), donation after cardiac death (DCD), and split/partial grafts were strongly associated with graft failure, while African-American race, less height, cerebrovascular accident and 'other' causes of brain death were more modestly but still significantly associated with graft failure.

abstract = {Assessment of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by common creatinine-based methods potentially is very inaccurate in patients with cirrhosis. Cirrhotic patients have several underlying conditions that contribute to falsely low serum creatinine concentrations, even in the presence of moderate to severe renal impairment, and often cause creatinine-based methods to overestimate true GFR. Such underlying conditions include decreased creatinine production secondary to decreased hepatic creatine synthesis, increased tubular creatinine secretion, and decreased skeletal muscle mass. These factors all contribute to serum creatinine concentrations that often do not accurately reflect renal function. Serum creatinine level, measured creatinine clearance, and calculated creatinine clearance may all significantly overestimate GFR; the degree of GFR overestimation was a median of 95{\%} in published studies. Until more accurate methods of estimating GFR in cirrhotic patients are adequately validated, care should be exercised in the management of these patients because of the potential for severely impaired renal function, even in the face of normal serum creatinine concentrations. {\textcopyright} 2003 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Although organ-preserving radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy has offered good locoregional control, many patients still experience recurrent disease requiring salvage laryngectomy. The pharyngocutaneous fistula (PCF) is a common and troublesome complication in the early post-operative period after laryngectomy. Here, we evaluated the cause of PCF after laryngectomy, with special emphasis on radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 63 consecutive patients undergoing salvage total laryngectomy for squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx at Kanazawa University Hospital from 1990 to 2005 were reviewed. Forty of the 63 had received primary total laryngectomy (PL). Ten patients underwent radiotherapy alone (SL-RT) and 13 patients underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy (SL-CRT) followed by salvage laryngectomy. RESULTS: Overall, 17 of the 63 patients (27.0{\%}) developed PCF after laryngectomy. Fisher's exact test showed a significant increase of PCF formation in SL-CRT (7/13, 53.8{\%}) compared with PL (7/40, 17.5{\%}) (p=0.0252). There were non-significant increases of PCF formation both in SL-CRT (7/13, 53.8{\%}) compared with SL-RT (3/10, 30.0{\%}) (p=0.4015), and also in SL-RT (3/10, 30.0{\%}) compared with PL (7/40, 17.5{\%}) (p=0.3969). The Mann-Whitney U-test showed that the duration of PCF was significantly longer for SL-CRT PCF (121.2+/-95.0 days) compared with those for PL (39.0+/-55.3 days) (p=0.0298) or SL-RT (28.0+/-16.2 days) (p=0.0325). However, we did not find a significant difference in the duration of PCF with respect to PL (39.0+/-55.3 days) and SL-RT (28.0+/-16.2 days) (p=0.4367). CONCLUSIONS: Although radiotherapy or chemotherapy has only a limited impact on PCF formation, concurrent chemoradiotherapy significantly increases PCF formation. The addition of chemotherapy to irradiation delays PCF closure.},

The most significant update creates a separate staging algorithm for high- risk human papillomavirus-associated cancer of the oropharynx, distinguishing it from oropharyngeal cancer with other causes. Other modifications include: the reorganizing of skin cancer (other than melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma) from a general chap- ter for the entire body to a head and neck-specific cutaneous malignancies chapter; division of cancer of the pharynx into 3 separate chapters; changes to the tumor (T) categories for oral cavity, skin, and nasopharynx; and the addition of extranodal can- cer extension to lymph node category (N) in all but the viral-related cancers and muco- sal melanoma. The Head and Neck Task Force worked with colleagues around the world to derive a staging system that reflects ongoing changes in head and neck oncology; it remains user friendly and consistent with the traditional tumor, lymph node, metastasis (TNM) staging paradigm.},

abstract = {Background: We sought to measure the impact of model for end stage liver disease (MELD) score, tumor staging, and microvascular invasion (MVI) on the relative survival benefit of liver transplantation (LT) versus liver resection (LR) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Results: Two hundred eighty-three patients (26 {\%}) with a MELD score of ≥10 had an acceptable 5-year survival after LR of 47 {\%}, while that of patients with a low MELD score was 67 {\%} (p {\textless} 0.0001). Mean 5-year LT benefit was −4.50 months (95 {\%} confidence interval [CI] −4.73 to −4.27) for patients with a MELD score of {\textless}10, and 0.81 months (95 {\%} CI 0.58 to 1.04) for those with a MELD score of ≥10. MELD score and MVI were the strongest predictors of transplant survival benefit. LT reached a survival benefit, versus LR only in HCC patients with a MELD score of ≥10 and without MVI (3.08 months, 95 {\%} CI 2.78 to 3.39), whatever the tumor stage.
Methods: The study population comprised 1,106 HCC patients with cirrhosis undergoing LR from one Eastern (n = 424) and two Western (n = 682) surgical units. Exclusion criteria were very large ({\textgreater}10 cm) tumors, macrovascular invasion, and metastases. We identified three tumor stages: stage I (within Milan, n = 806), stage II (beyond Milan within Up-to-7, n = 123), and stage III (beyond Milan and Up-to-7, n = 177). Patient survival after LR was compared to that predicted after LT by the Metroticket calculator in relationship with staging, MVI, and MELD score using Monte Carlo simulation.
Conclusions: LT proved to be harmful in patients with resectable HCC with a low MELD score ({\textless}10) or with aggressive tumors (with MVI). As a result of a shortage of donors, only selected resectable tumors with a MELD score of ≥10 should be considered for transplantation.},

In this study, the results failed to reveal any clear evidence of time-of-day effects on voice range profile performance, for any of the dependent variables. However, a reliable interaction of time-of-day and trial order was obtained for average minimum intensity. Investigation of other subject populations, in particular trained vocalists or those with laryngeal lesions, is required for any generalization of the results.},

abstract = {Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that guide the post-transcriptional processing of other non-coding RNAs (mostly ribosomal RNAs), but have also been implicated in processes ranging from microRNA-dependent gene silencing to alternative splicing. In order to construct an up-to-date catalog of human snoRNAs we have combined data from various databases, de novo prediction and extensive literature review. In total, we list more than 750 curated genomic loci that give rise to snoRNA and snoRNA-like genes. Utilizing small RNA-seq data from the ENCODE project, our study characterizes the plasticity of snoRNA expression identifying both constitutively as well as cell type specific expressed snoRNAs. Especially, the comparison of malignant to non-malignant tissues and cell types shows a dramatic perturbation of the snoRNA expression profile. Finally, we developed a high-throughput variant of the reverse-transcriptase-based method for identifying 2'-O-methyl modifications in RNAs termed RimSeq. Using the data from this and other high-throughput protocols together with previously reported modification sites and state-of-the-art target prediction methods we re-estimate the snoRNA target RNA interaction network. Our current results assign a reliable modification site to 83{\%} of the canonical snoRNAs, leaving only 76 snoRNA sequences as orphan.},

abstract = {Meningiomas are the second-most common intracranial tumours in adults. They are derived from the arachnoid cells, and although approximately 90{\%} of meningiomas are benign, more than half of all meningiomas develop peritumoral brain oedema (PTBE), which increases morbidity. The PTBE can be treated with steroid therapy, but this treatment is not specific, is not always effective, and involves long-term side-effects. Meningiomas are treated with radiation therapy, stereotactic radio-surgery or surgical resection. At the moment surgical resection is the only definite treatment, and the removal of the tumour also removes the PTBE. Based on the localization of the meningioma, surgery can be complicated. Although PTBE around meningiomas is frequent, the mechanisms behind its development are not clearly understood. It is believed that due to tumour growth and local tissue hypoxia, angiogenesis is increased and leads to the formation of PTBE. The angiogenic protein vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) is believed to be involved in the formation of PTBE around meningiomas, as several studies have found that it is increased in meningiomas with PTBE. VEGF-A is also known as vascular permeability factor due to its ability to increase the permeability of capillaries. Paper I examines the VEGF-A protein and mRNA levels in 101 intracranial meningiomas. The PTBE is quantified on MRI, and capillary length and tumour water content are measured and compared to control brain tissue. Possible co-factors to PTBE like meningioma localization and subtypes are also examined. Forty-three of the patients have primary, solitary, supratentorial meningiomas with PTBE. The correlation between PTBE or edema index with the VEGF-A protein and mRNA, capillary length, and tumour water content is investigated in these patients. A novel method is used for mRNA quantification. It involves direct amplification of the mRNA with probes and branched DNA in order to produce a chemiluminescence signal that can be measured using a luminometer. The paper shows that the oedema index is correlated to the VEGF-A protein and mRNA, and that capillary length is correlated to the PTBE. It also finds that VEGF-A protein and mRNA, capillary length and water content is increased in meningiomas compared to control tissue, suggesting that VEGF-A is produced in, and possibly secreted from the meningiomas. In addition, supratentorial meningiomas are shown to have larger PTBE compared to infratentorial meningiomas, suggesting that infratentorial meningiomas are diagnosed and removed earlier, due to earlier symptom development based on the anatomical features of the fossa posterior. Finally, a gender-specific difference in tumour water content and VEGF-A protein is revealed (higher and lower in females, respectively). Paper II is a method-comparison study pitting the chemiluminescence assay against the often used quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay. In RT-qPCR, RNA is isolated, measured, reverse transcribed, purified, amplified via real-time PCR, and analyzed. The method is robust and reliable, albeit laborious to some extent. The chemiluminescence assay detects RNA directly without the need for RNA purification, complement DNA synthesis or cyclic amplification. By comparing the output of the two protocols to a dilution series ranging from 1 to 128 times of the homogenized samples, the precision of the protocols is measured. Furthermore, VEGF-A/GAPDH ratios are quantified for 15 tissue samples and the results compared between the two protocols, showing significant correlation. The study finds that the chemiluminescence assay is competitive to RT-qPCR, and reflects a similar pattern in gene expression measurement with a similar precision. Whether one method or the other should be used depends on the variability of the samples, budget, and time. RT-qPCR has a much wider dynamic range, and is preferable in case of significant sample inter-variability. It is also less expensive, and gives the user more flexibility as homemade reagents can be used. On the other hand, the chemiluminescence assay is straight forward, requires less hands-on-time, and can be used on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. Paper III continues the investigations in paper I. The sample size is increased so that 22 angiomatous and secretory meningiomas are compared to 40 non-angiomatous meningiomas and 10 control brain tissue samples. Angiomatous and secretory meningiomas are chosen because they are known to have larger PTBE compared to other meningiomas. In addition to VEGF-A, capillary length, and PTBE, the VEGF-A tyrosine kinase receptor VEGFR-2 mRNA and protein levels are also examined. VEGFR-2 is a transmembrane receptor found on endothelial cells. It binds VEGF-A and thereby increases angiogenesis. VEGFR-2's co-receptor neuropilin-1 is also examined. Neuropilin-1 is an agonist of angiogenesis through complex-binding of VEGF-A, but it can also work as an inhibitor through competitive binding of semaphorin-3A. The complex binding of semaphorin-3A to neuropilin-1 can also induce endothelial cell apoptosis, thus working as an antagonist of angiogenesis. The study finds that VEGF-A mRNA, VEGF-A protein, and neuropilin-1 mRNA are higher in angiomatous and non-angiomatous meningiomas compared to controls. VEGFR-2 protein is higher, and neuropilin-1 protein lower in angiomatous meningiomas compared to controls. The mean capillary length is 3614 mm/mm3 in angiomatous, 605 mm/mm3 in non-angiomatous meningiomas, and 229 mm/mm3 in the controls. Non-angiomatous and angiomatous meningioma patients have equally sized tumours. The mean PTBE around the angiomatous meningiomas is 695 cm3, i.e. 477 cm3 larger than the non-angiomatous meningiomas (p = 0.0045), and the mean oedema index is twice the size compared to the non-angiomatous meningiomas. Further comparison between the two meningioma groups shows that mean VEGF-A mRNA, VEGFR-2 protein, and neuropilin-1 mRNA is significantly higher and neuropilin-1 protein is lower in the angiomatous meningiomas. We believe that the VEGF-A pathway participates in the formation of PTBE in meningiomas by inducing formation of "leaky" capillaries, resulting in secretion of VEGF-A and plasma to the peritumoural brain tissue. It may therefore be worth pursuing therapies targeted directly against VEGF-A and its receptors through drugs like bevacizumab, sorafenib, sunitifib, and cediranib.},

Unfortunately, corticosteroids are associated with numerous and well-characterized adverse effects, constituting a major challenge in patients requiring long-term application of corticosteroids. Novel antiangiogenic agents, such as bevacizumab (Avastin{\textregistered}), which have been increasingly used in cancer patients, are associated with significant steroid-sparing effects, allowing neuro-oncologists to reduce the overall use of corticosteroids in patients with progressive malignant brain tumors. Recent experimental studies have revealed novel insights into the mechanisms and effects of corticosteroids in cancer patients, including modulation of tumor biology, angiogenesis and steroid-associated neurotoxicity.

A competing risk is an event that either hinders the observation of the event of interest or modifies the chance that this event occurs. For example, when studying death on dialysis, receiving a kidney transplant is an event that competes with the event of interest. Conventional methods for survival analysis ignoring the competing event(s), such as the Kaplan-Meier method and standard Cox proportional hazards regression, may be inappropriate in the presence of competing risks, and alternative methods specifically designed for analysing competing risks data should then be applied. This problem deserves more attention in nephrology research and in the current article, we therefore explain the problem of competing risks in survival analysis and how using different techniques may affect study results. },

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective single-center analysis used a transplant database to identify all adult patients who underwent a primary LT and had data on 10 days of post-LT laboratory variables at the Dumont-UCLA Transplant Center of the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA between February 1, 2002, and June 30, 2015. Data collection took place from January 4, 2016, to June 30, 2016. Data analysis was conducted from July 1, 2016, to August 30, 2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Three-month graft failure-free survival. RESULTS Of 2021 patients who underwent primary LT over the study period, 2008 (99.4{\%}) had available perioperative data and were included in the analysis. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of recipients was 56 (49-62) years, and 1294 recipients (64.4{\%}) were men. Overall survival and graft-failure-free survival rates were 83{\%}and 81{\%}at year 1, 74{\%}and 71{\%} at year 3, and 69{\%}and 65{\%}at year 5, with an 11.1{\%}(222 recipients) incidence of 3-month graft failure or death. Multivariate factors associated with 3-month graft failure-free survival included post-LT aspartate aminotransferase level, international normalized ratio, bilirubin level, and platelet count, measures of which were used to calculate the Liver Graft Assessment Following Transplantation (L-GrAFT) risk score. The L-GrAFT model had an excellent C statistic of 0.85, with a significantly superior discrimination of 3-month graft failure-free survival compared with the existing EAD definition (C statistic, 0.68; P {\textless} .001) and the MEAF score (C statistic, 0.70; P {\textless} .001). Compared with patients with lower L-GrAFT risk, LT recipients in the highest 10th percentile of L-GrAFT scores had higher Model for End-Stage Liver Disease scores (median [IQR], 34 [26-40] vs 31 [25-38]; P = .005); greater need for pretransplant hospitalization (56.8{\%}vs 44.8{\%}; P = .003), renal replacement therapy (42.9{\%}vs 30.5{\%}; P {\textless} .001), mechanical ventilation (35.8{\%} vs 18.1{\%}; P {\textless} .001), and vasopressors (22.9{\%} vs 11.0{\%}; P {\textless} .001); longer cold ischemia times (median [IQR], 436 [311-539] vs 401 [302-506] minutes; P = .04); greater intraoperative blood transfusions (median [IQR], 17 [10-26] vs 10 [6-17] units of packed red blood cells; P {\textless} .001); and older donors (median [IQR] age, 47 [28-56] vs 41 [25-52] years; P {\textless} .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The L-GrAFT risk score allows a highly accurate, individualized risk estimation of 3-month graft failure following LT that is more accurate than existing EAD and MEAF scores. Multicenter validation may allow for the adoption of the L-GrAFT as a tool for evaluating the need for a retransplant, for establishing standardized grading of early allograft function across transplant centers, and as a highly accurate clinical end point in translational studies aiming to mitigate ischemia or reperfusion injury by modulating donor quality and recipient factors.},

abstract = {Assessment of patient quality of life (QOL) requires balancing the details provided by multi-item assessments with the reduced burden of single-item assessments. In this project, we investigated the psychometric properties of single-item Linear Analog Scale Assessments (LASAs) for patients with newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas. Measures included QOL LASAs (overall, physical, emotional, spiritual, intellectual), Symptom Distress Scale (SDS), Profile of Mood States (POMS; overall, confusion, fatigue), and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-Br; overall, brain, physical, emotional). Associations of LASA measures with SDS, POMS, and FACT-Br domains and with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score (PS) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were assessed. Repeated measures ANOVA models compared the change over time of LASAs and SDS, POMS, and FACT-Br. Two hundred five patients completed the assessments across three time points. To allow comparison across measures, all scores were converted to a scale of 0-100, with higher scores indicating better QOL. LASA mean scores ranged from 60 to 78; SDS, POMS, and FACT-Br ranged from 62 to 81. FACT-Br physical (P {\textless} 0.001) and POMS fatigue subscale (P = 0.005) decreased over time, as did LASA physical (P = 0.08). LASA scales were strongly associated with corresponding scales on SDS, POMS, and FACT-Br (0.44 {\textless} rho {\textless} 0.65; P {\textless} 0.001). LASA was negatively associated with PS and positively with MMSE, with associations similar in magnitude to the other QOL and psychosocial measures. The data suggest that the single-item LASA scales are valid for assessing QOL of cancer patients and are an appropriate alternative when a shorter instrument is warranted. ?? 2007 U.S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee.},

abstract = {Objectives/Hypothesis: Maximum phonation time (MPT), a clinical measurement of the longest time one can phonate a vowel, typically /a/, is a frequently used measure of vocal function, but normative data are lacking for MPT in healthy older adults. The aim of this study was to provide data on MPT in healthy older adults and to determine the effect of advanced age, gender, and repeated measures on MPT. Study Design: Prospective. Methods: Sixty-nine healthy older adult volunteers participated (ie, 15, 26, and 28 in the seventh, eighth, and ninth decades of life, respectively). The effects of age, gender, and repeated measures (three trials in a single session) on MPT were assessed. Mean, standard deviation, compound symmetry covariance, analysis of variance, and analysis of covariance were used for statistical analysis. Results: Neither age group, gender, trial, nor their interactions was statistically significant (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Adults in the seventh, eighth, and ninth decades of life had mean MPTs of 22.27 (standard error [SE] = 1.56), 22.97 (SE = 1.11), and 21.14 (SE = 0.97) seconds, respectively. Females and males had mean MPTs of 20.96 (SE = 0.92) and 23.23 (SE = 0.96) seconds, respectively. Finally, MPTs for trials 1, 2, and 3 were 21.77 (SE = 1.09), 21.67 (SE = 1.12), and 22.80 (SE = 1.27), respectively. Conclusions: MPTs were longer in this group of older adults than previously reported and did not vary significantly with age or gender. Additionally, across a single short sampling session, measurements were relatively stable across three trials of MPTs. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Voice Foundation.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess equivalence of the US version and several translations including (1) Dutch, (2) Flemish Dutch (Belgium), (3) UK English, (4) French, (5) German, (6) Italian, (7) Portuguese and (8) Swedish. VHI questionnaires were gathered from 1,281 subjects. Patients were classified into 11 voice lesion categories. Patients with incomplete response (4{\%}) and patients within voice lesion categories with small numbers were excluded from further analyses, leaving a cohort of 1,052 patients from 8 countries. RESULTS: The internal consistency of the VHI proved to be good. Confirmatory factor analysis across countries revealed that a 3-factor fixed measurement model best fitted the data; the 3 subscales appeared to highly intercorrelated, especially in the US data. The underlying structure of the VHI was also equivalent regarding various voice lesions, but distinct groups were recognized with respect to the height of the VHI scores, indicating that various voice lesions lead to a diversity of voice problems in daily life. CONCLUSION: The US VHI and the translations appeared to be equivalent, which means that the results from studies from the various included countries can be compared.},

abstract = {Abstract Rationale: Ramsay-Hunt's syndrome (RHS) is a disorder characterized by facial paralysis, herpetic eruptions on the auricle, and otic pain due to the reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus in the geniculate ganglion. A few cases of multiple cranial nerve invasion including the vestibulocochlear nerve, glossopharyngeal nerve and vagus nerve have been reported. However, there has been no report about RHS with delayed onset multiple cranial nerve involvement causing severe aspiration, and a clinical course that improved after more than one year of dysphagia rehabilitation and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). Here, we report on a 67-year old male with delayed onset swallowing difficulty after 16 days of RHS development. Patient concern: Severe aspiration during swallowing. Diagnosis: Severe dysphagia caused by RHS with multiple cranial nerve involvement. Intervention: Application of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and rehabilitation therapy of dysphagia. Outcomes: After 13 months from symptom onset, his PAS improved from 7 to 2 in follow-up video-fluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS). Then, he was re-admitted, and the PEG tube was removed and oral feeding was started. Lessons: This case gives us the lesson that optimal doses of acyclovir and corticosteroids are important to prevent progression of multiple cranial involvement in RHS, and swallowing difficulty in RHS patients with multiple cranial nerve involvement can be improved through long-term rehabilitation even if there is no improvement for more than one year.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the voice and vocal fold pliability outcomes of European Laryngological Society (ELS) deep type I (subepithelial) and type II (subligamentous) cordectomies for early glottic cancer. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of patients with glottic carcinoma at a tertiary care medical center between 2005 and 2011. Their procedures were stratified into ELS type I and ELS type II cordectomies. The data recorded included age, gender, tumor stage, recurrence, patient-assessed voice-related quality of life, perceptual voice evaluation, and stroboscopy. RESULTS: Four patients were identified as having subepithelial cordectomy, and 13 as having subligamentous cordectomy. The average preoperative and postoperative voice-related quality of life scores were 65 and 74 for the ELS I cohort and 64 and 95 for the ELS II group. The preoperative and postoperative perceptual voice evaluation scores were 56 and 35 for the ELS I cohort and 45 and 21 for the ELS II cohort. The ELS I cohort had a moderately to severely reduced mucosal wave, with 75{\%} of patients demonstrating glottic insufficiency, whereas the ELS II cohort had a mildly to moderately reduced mucosal wave, with 8{\%} of patients demonstrating glottic insufficiency. The survival outcomes were the same. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who underwent subligamentous excision of early glottic cancer had significantly improved postoperative voice and stroboscopy scores. This finding suggests that if tumor resection reaches the vocal ligament, and minimal superficial lamina propria can be preserved, subligamentous cordectomy should be performed.},

Type I thyroplasty in combination with arytenoid adduction is a proven technique for medialization of the paralyzed vocal fold but must be evaluated in light of potential complications following laryngeal framework surgery. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The charts of 237 patients who underwent unilateral vocal fold medialization surgery between July 1, 1991, and August 30, 1999, at a tertiary care cancer referral center were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: There were 98 cases of type I thyroplasty alone and 96 cases of type I thyroplasty with arytenoid adduction. The two groups had similar patient characteristics. Mean time of surgery (45 vs. 73 min, P {\textless}.0001) and length of hospital stay (1.1 vs. 1.8 d, P {\textless}.0001) were increased when arytenoid adduction was performed. Overall improvement of symptoms was similar in both groups (93{\%}-94{\%}), but posterior glottic closure appeared subjectively improved when arytenoid adduction was used (P =.0054). Overall complication rates were slightly higher in the arytenoid adduction group (14{\%} vs. 19{\%}), primarily because of transient vocal fold edema and wound complications (9 vs. 19 cases), but the increase was not statistically significant (P =.1401). Complications warranting medical or surgical intervention occurred in 8{\%} of cases. Two patients who underwent type I thyroplasty with arytenoid adduction required tracheotomy as a consequence of postoperative complications. The three patients who had extrusion of the implant underwent type I thyroplasty alone. CONCLUSION: Using the appropriate technique, the potential benefits of improved glottic function following type I thyroplasty with arytenoid adduction outweigh the small risk of significant complications observed.},

abstract = {When coming to terms with a diagnosis of laryngeal cancer, patients find different ways of coping with their illness. These may or may not be related to communication. Vocal aspects of quality of life are particularly important with cancer of the larynx. The correlation between coping and subjective assessment of the voice-related quality of life was assessed in a cross-sectional study of patients after resection of T1 and T2 laryngeal tumours. As part of follow-up care, 55 male cancer patients with partial laryngectomy were asked about their voice-related quality of life and their coping strategies. The Voice-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (V-RQOL) and the Trier Coping Scales (TCS) were used as survey instruments. The voice-related quality of life of the patients was assessed on average as medium to good. The coping strategy most frequently chosen by patients was 'threat prevention', followed by 'search for social integration', 'rumination', 'search for information and experience exchange' and 'search for support in religion'. Correlations between coping strategy and the voice-related quality of life were weak to moderate and somewhat inconsistent in this patient population. There was no consistent or strong correlation between voice-related quality of life and coping strategies in male patients with partial laryngectomy, so that individual differences appeared to be more important in coping with illness than primarily voice-related factors such as the voice-related quality of life.},

abstract = {Meningioma is the second most common type of adult intracranial neoplasm. A substantial subset of patients present with peritumoral brain edema (PTBE), which can cause significant morbidity via mass effect, complicate surgical management, and impact the safety of stereotactic radiosurgery. Recent studies suggest a close relationship between vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) expression and PTBE development in meningiomas. The authors performed a systematic review of the literature on the pathogenesis of PTBE in meningiomas, the effectiveness of steroid therapy, the role played by VEGF-A, and the current clinical evidence for antiangiogenic therapy to treat peritumoral brain edema. Mounting evidence suggests VEGF-A is secreted directly by meningioma cells to induce angiogenesis and edemagenesis of tumoral as well as peritumoral brain tissue. The VEGF-A cascade results in recruitment of cerebral-pial vessels and disruption of the tumor-brain barrier, which appear to be requisite for VEGF-A to have an edemagenic effect. Results of preliminary clinical studies suggest VEGF-directed therapy has modest activity against recurrent and progressive meningioma growth but can alleviate PTBE in some patients. A comprehensive understanding of the VEGF-A pathway and its modulators may hold the key to an effective therapeutic approach to treating PTBE associated with meningiomas. Further clinical trials with larger patient cohorts and longer follow-up periods are warranted to confirm the efficacy of VEGF-directed therapy.},

abstract = {The patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) on the liver transplant waiting list are prioritized for transplant based on the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. We developed and used an innovative approach to compare MELD to six proposed alternatives with respect to waiting list mortality. Our analysis was based on United Network for Organ Sharing data of patients with ESLD on the waiting list between January 2006 and June 2009. We compared six allocation models to MELD. Two models were based on reweighting the variables used by MELD: an "updated" MELD, and ReFit MELD. Four models also included serum sodium: MESO, MeldNa, UKELD, and ReFit MELDNa. We estimated that UKELD and the updated MELD would result in significantly fewer lives saved. There were no significant differences between the other models. Our new approach can supplement standard methods to provide insight into the relative performance of liver allocation models in reducing waiting list mortality. Our analysis suggests that UKELD and the updated MELD score would not be optimal for reducing waiting list mortality in the United States. {\textcopyright} 2012 European Society for Organ Transplantation.},

For the longitudinal model of continuous and binary responses, we investigate multivariate generalized linear mixed models using shared random effects. Longitudinal and time- to-event data are assumed to be independent conditional on available covariates and shared parameters. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, implemented in OpenBUGS, is used for parameter estimation. To illustrate practical considerations in choosing a final model, we fit 37 different candidate models using all possible combinations of random effects and employ a Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) to select a best fitting model. We demonstrate the prediction of future event probabilities within a fixed time interval for patients utilizing baseline data, post-baseline longitudinal responses, and the time-to-event outcome. The performance of our joint model is also evaluated in simulation studies.},

abstract = {Allocation of liver grafts triggers emotional debates, as those patients, not receiving an organ, are prone to death. We analyzed a high–Model of End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) cohort (laboratory MELD score ≥30, n = 100, median laboratory MELD score of 35; interquartile range 31–37) of liver transplant recipients at our center during the past 10 years and compared results with a low-MELD group, matched by propensity scoring for donor age, recipient age, and cold ischemia time. End points of our study were cumulative posttransplantation morbidity, cost, and survival. Six different prediction models, including donor age x recipient MELD (D-MELD), Difference between listing MELD and MELD at transplant (Delta MELD), donor-risk index (DRI), Survival Outcomes Following Liver Transplant (SOFT), balance-of-risk (BAR), and University of California Los Angeles–Futility Risk Score (UCLA-FRS), were applied in both cohorts to identify risk for poor outcome and high cost. All score models were compared with a clinical-oriented decision, based on the combination of hemofiltration plus ventilation. Median intensive care unit and hospital stays were 8 and 26 days, respectively, after liver transplantation of high-MELD patients, with a significantly increased morbidity compared with low-MELD patients (median comprehensive complication index 56 vs. 36 points [maximum points 100] and double cost [median US{\$}179 631 vs. US{\$}80 229]). Five-year survival, however, was only 8{\%} less than that of low-MELD patients (70{\%} vs. 78{\%}). Most prediction scores showed disappointing low positive predictive values for posttransplantation mortality, such as mortality above thresholds, despite good specificity. The clinical observation of hemofiltration plus ventilation in high-MELD patients was even superior in this respect compared with D-MELD, DRI, Delta MELD, and UCLA-FRS but inferior to SOFT and BAR models. Of all models tested, only the BAR score was linearly associated with complications. In conclusion, the BAR score was most useful for risk classification in liver transplantation, based on expected posttransplantation mortality and morbidity. Difficult decisions to accept liver grafts in high-risk recipients may thus be guided by additional BAR score calculation, to increase the safe use of scarce organs.},

abstract = {Hyponatremia in cirrhosis is defined as a serum sodium level ≤130 mEq/L and occurs in approximately 22{\%} of patients with cirrhosis. The appearance of hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis portends a poor prognosis before liver transplantation (LT), independent of the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. With the development of the MELD-sodium score, the management of hyponatremia has become more relevant than ever before. Overcorrection of hyponatremia before LT or perioperatively can lead to the devastating neurologic condition known as osmotic demyelination syndrome, which is often irreversible and fatal. Therefore, the most important tenet of hyponatremia is to avoid correcting the serum sodium by ≥8 mEq/L in a 24-hour period. Treatment of hyponatremia is highly challenging. The vast majority of patients with cirrhosis have chronic hypervolemic hyponatremia. Fluid restriction increases serum sodium levels, but tolerance and compliance are significant barriers. Diuretic withdrawal is helpful but contributes to worsening fluid overload. There are limited data to support use of intravenous concentrated albumin solutions. The use of the arginine vasopressin antagonists (“vaptans”) is contentious; however, they may have a limited role. Risk factors for intraoperative overcorrection of serum sodium include increased utilization of packed red blood cell and fresh frozen plasma transfusions, which are often unavoidable. Intraoperative management is evolving, and more data are needed in regard to the use of sodium-reduced continuous venovenous hemofiltration and the use of trishydroxymethylaminomethane (Tris) to avoid excess sodium rebound. A thorough discussion of the current treatment options before and during LT is given in this review.},

abstract = {Laryngectomy for carcinoma of the larynx has been performed since it was first described in 1880. Since that time the complication of tracheostomal stenosis has plagued both surgeons and patients. The reported incidence of tracheostomal stenosis ranges from 4{\%} to 42{\%}. At West Virginia University Hospitals from 1976 to 1994, 106 patients undergoing laryngectomies on the head and neck oncology service were analyzed. The charts of patients treated before 1991 were reviewed retrospectively; a prospective analysis was initiated in 1991. Only patients with a minimum of 6 months of follow-up were included in this study. The male-to-female ratio was 3:1, with an age range of 28 to 86 years (mean, 58 years). The overall rate of stenosis was 28.4{\%}. The incidence of tracheostomal stenosis was higher in women (46.4{\%}) than in men (21.6{\%}) (p {\textless} 0.05). Since 1991 a plastic type of closure was used in 25 patients. The stenosis rate was 0{\%} in these patients. Before 1991 a bevel or circle technique was used, with stenosis rates of 33{\%} and 75{\%}, respectively (p {\textless} 0.05). Infection at the site of the stoma, fistula, steroid use, neck dissection, pectoralis major myocutaneous flap usage, primary tracheoesophageal puncture, and radiotherapy did not correlate with an increased incidence of stenosis. The most important factor in prevention of stomal stenosis after laryngectomy is attention to detail while forming the stoma. With good technique and a plastic-type closure to break up the suture line, a minimal rate of stenosis should be encountered.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims All oral direct acting antivirals (DAA) have been shown to improve the liver function of patients with decompensated cirrhosis but it is presently unknown whether this clinical improvement may lead to the delisting of some patients. The aim of this study was to assess if and which patients can be first inactivated due to clinically improvement and subsequently delisted in a real life setting. Methods 103 consecutive listed patients without hepatocellular carcinoma were treated with different DAA combinations in 11 European centres between February 2014 and February 2015. Results The cumulative incidence of inactivated and delisted patients by competing risk analysis was 15.5{\%} and 0{\%} at 24 weeks, 27.6{\%} and 10.3{\%} at 48 weeks, 33.3{\%} and 19.2{\%} at 60 weeks. The 34 patients who were inactivated showed a median improvement of 3.4 points for MELD (delta MELD, p {\textless}0.0001) and 2 points for Child-Pugh (CP) (delta-CP, p {\textless}0.0001). Three variables emerged from the most parsimonious multivariate competing risk model as predictors of inactivation for clinical improvement, namely, baseline MELD classes (MELD 16–20: HR = 0.120; p = 0.0005, MELD {\textgreater}20:HR = 0.042; p {\textless}0.0001), delta MELD (HR = 1.349; p {\textless}0.0001) and delta albumin (HR = 0.307; p = 0.0069) both assessed after 12 weeks of DAA therapy. Conclusions This study showed that all oral DAAs were able to reverse liver dysfunction and favoured the inactivation and delisting of about one patient out-of-three and one patient out-of-five in 60 weeks, respectively. Patients with lower MELD scores had higher chances to be delisted. The longer term benefits of therapy need to be ascertained. Lay summary The excellent efficacy and safety profile of the new drugs against Hepatitis C virus, “direct acting antivirals” or DAAs, have made antiviral therapy possible also for patients with advanced liver disease and for those on the waiting list for liver transplantation (LT). This study shows for the first time that the DAAs may lead to a remarkable clinical improvement allowing the delisting of one patient out of 5.},

The only study conducted among women on mouth and pharynx cancer risk, however, reported an inverse association. This study aims to investigate the association between height and the risk of head and neck cancer (HNC) within a large international consortium of HNC. We analyzed pooled individual-level data from 24 case-control studies participating in the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology Consortium. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated separately for men and women for associations between height and HNC risk. Educational level, tobacco smoking, and alcohol consumption were included in all regression models. Stratified analyses by HNC subsites were performed. This project included 17,666 cases and 28,198 controls. We found an inverse association between height and HNC (adjusted OR per 10 cm height = 0.91; 95{\%} CI 5 0.86-0.95 for men; adjusted OR = 0.86; 95{\%} CI 5 0.79-0.93 for women). In men, the estimated OR did vary by educational level, smoking status, geographic area, and control source. No differences by subsites were detected. Adult height is inversely associated with HNC risk. As height can be considered a marker of childhood illness and low energy intake, the inverse association is consistent with prior studies showing that HNC occur more frequently among deprived individuals. Further studies designed to elucidate the mechanism of such association would be warranted.},

The occurrence of hyponatremia in these patients has been associated with increased mortality on the waiting list. The importance of serum sodium levels and the presence of ascites in the pediatric setting remain to be clarified. A retrospective analysis of pediatric patients with cirrhosis on the transplant list was carried out between October 2000 and February 2012. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the association of pretransplant variables with mortality within 90 days following the inclusion of patients on the waiting list. In all, 522 patients were included in the study; 345 (66{\%}) patients were under 1 year of age; 208 (40{\%}) of the children presented ascites. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis was conducted and total bilirubin (P {\textless} 0.001, hazard ratio [HR] = 2.09, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.35-3.21), international normalized ratio (INR) (P {\textless} 0.001, HR = 9.83, 95{\%} CI = 4.51-21.45), serum sodium levels (P = 0.03, HR = 0.96, 95{\%} CI = 0.92-0.99), ascites (P = 0.001, HR = 2.59, 95{\%} CI = 1.44-4.64), and categorized age (0-1 versus ≥1 year old) (P = 0.025, HR = 2.33, 95{\%} CI = 1.11-4.86) were independently associated with risk of death in 90 days. Malnutrition (Z score height/age, weight/age) and serum albumin (pediatric endstage liver disease [PELD] formula) were not included in the final model. Conclusion: The presence of ascites and serum sodium levels are important variables associated with decreased patient survival while candidates wait for a liver graft. Multicenter studies are necessary to validate these findings in order to improve current allocation policies based on the PELD score. (Hepatology 2014;59:1964-1971).},

abstract = {The survival benefit of liver transplantation depends on candidate disease severity, as measured by MELD score. However, donor liver quality may also affect survival benefit. Using US data from the SRTR on 28 165 adult liver transplant candidates wait-listed between 2001 and 2005, we estimated survival benefit according to cross-classifications of candidate MELD score and deceased donor risk index (DRI) using sequential stratification. Covariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) were calculated for each liver transplant recipient at a given MELD with an organ of a given DRI, comparing posttransplant mortality to continued wait-listing with possible later transplantation using a lower-DRI organ. High-DRI organs were more often transplanted into lower-MELD recipients and vice versa. Compared to waiting for a lower-DRI organ, the lowest-MELD category recipients (MELD 6-8) who received high-DRI organs experienced significantly higher mortality (HR = 3.70; p {\textless} 0.0005). All recipients with MELD {\textgreater} or =20 had a significant survival benefit from transplantation, regardless of DRI. Transplantation of high-DRI organs is effective for high but not low-MELD candidates. Pairing of high-DRI livers with lower-MELD candidates fails to maximize survival benefit and may deny lifesaving organs to high-MELD candidates who are at high risk of death without transplantation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The time to begin oral feeding after total laryngectomy remains a subject of debate among head and neck surgeons. The prevailing assumption is that early initiation of oral feeding may cause pharyngocutaneous fistula; thus, the common practice of initiating oral feeding after a period of 7 to 10 days. The objective of the study was to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of oral feeding 48 hours after total laryngectomy. STUDY DESIGN: Two-part study includes, first, a sequential study and, second, a prospective analysis of our practice. METHODS: Patients undergoing total laryngectomy without partial pharyngectomy or radiation treatment (except irradiation through small ports for a T1 or T2 glottic carcinoma) were included. In the first, sequential part of the study (part I), a group of 18 patients who were fed 7 to 10 days after total laryngectomy (control group) was compared with a group of 20 patients who received oral feeding within 48 hours. To confirm the results of part I, a prospective analysis of this practice was conducted (part II) in which 35 additional patients who met the above criteria were fed within 48 hours after surgery. RESULTS: In part I, pharyngocutaneous fistula occurred in one patient (5{\%}) in the early feeding group and in two patients (11{\%}) in the control group. In part II, pharyngocutaneous fistula occurred in one patient (2.8{\%}). Overall, fistula occurred in two patients in the combined early feeding group (3.6{\%}). This rate of pharyngocutaneous fistula compares favorably with the fistula rate in the control group of 18 patients. Pharyngeal stricture that required dilation occurred in three of our patients in the study group and two in the control group (5.5{\%} vs. 11{\%}, respectively). The length of hospital stay was significantly shortened from 12 to 7 days. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that in this patient population initiation of oral feeding 48 hours after total laryngectomy is a safe clinical practice.},

We calculated the posttransplantation survival of all adult, first-time, deceased-donor, liver transplant recipients in the United States since the introduction of the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease based priority system in February 2002 (n = 36 791). We estimated the posttreatment survival of patients with Child's A cirrhosis and stage II HCC treated by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) ± transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or surgical resection by conducting a systematic review of the medical literature. In patients with Child's A cirrhosis and stage II HCC, the estimated median survival benefit of liver transplantation compared to RFA ± TACE was 1.5 months at 3 years (range -3.5 to 5.6) and 5.7 months at 5 years (range 0.7-11.4), whereas compared to surgical resection it was 0.7 months at 3 years (range -2.9 to 3) and 2.8 months at 5 years (range -4.4 to 5.7). Liver transplantation in patients with stage II HCC and Child's A cirrhosis results in a very low survival benefit and may not constitute optimal use of scarce liver donor organs.

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a frequent syndrome (30{\%} prevalence), characterized by acute decompensation of cirrhosis, organ failure(s) and high short-term mortality. This study develops and validates a specific prognostic score for ACLF patients. Methods: Data from 1349 patients included in the CANONIC study were used. First, a simplified organ function scoring system (CLIF Consortium Organ Failure score, CLIF-C OFs) was developed to diagnose ACLF using data from all patients. Subsequently, in 275 patients with ACLF, CLIF-C OFs and two other independent predictors of mortality (age and white blood cell count) were combined to develop a specific prognostic score for ACLF (CLIF Consortium ACLF score [CLIF-C ACLFs]). A concordance index (C-index) was used to compare the discrimination abilities of CLIF-C ACLF, MELD, MELD-sodium (MELD-Na), and Child-Pugh (CPs) scores. The CLIF-C ACLFs was validated in an external cohort and assessed for sequential use. Results: The CLIF-C ACLFs showed a significantly higher predictive accuracy than MELDs, MELD-Nas, and CPs, reducing (19-28{\%}) the corresponding prediction error rates at all main time points after ACLF diagnosis (28, 90, 180, and 365 days) in both the CANONIC and the external validation cohort. CLIF-C ACLFs computed at 48 h, 3-7 days, and 8-15 days after ACLF diagnosis predicted the 28-day mortality significantly better than at diagnosis. Conclusions: The CLIF-C ACLFs at ACLF diagnosis is superior to the MELDs and MELD-Nas in predicting mortality. The CLIF-C ACLFs is a clinically relevant, validated scoring system that can be used sequentially to stratify the risk of mortality in ACLF patients.},

abstract = {In cross-national comparisons based on questionnaires, accurate translations are necessary to obtain valid results. Differential item functioning (DIF) analysis can be used to test whether translations of items in multi-item scales are equivalent to the original. In data from 10,815 respondents representing 10 European languages we tested for DIF in the nine translations of the EORTC QLQ-C30 emotional function scale when compared to the original English version. We tested for DIF using two different methods in parallel, a contingency table method and logistic regression. The DIF results obtained with the two methods were similar. We found indications of DIF in seven of the nine translations. At least two of the DIF findings seem to reflect linguistic problems in the translation. 'Imperfect' translations can affect conclusions drawn from cross-national comparisons. Given that translations can never be identical to the original we discuss how findings of DIF can be interpreted and discuss the difference between linguistic DIF and DIF caused by confounding, cross-cultural differences, or DIF in other items in the scale. We conclude that testing for DIF is a useful way to validate questionnaire translations.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the utility of the hybrid tracheoesophageal puncture procedure in stapler-assisted laryngectomy. METHODS: Patients who underwent total laryngectomy at a single institution from 2009 to 2015 were reviewed. The interventions assessed were surgical creation of a tracheoesophageal puncture and placement of a voice prosthesis. The outcomes measured included voicing ability and valve failure. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients underwent total laryngectomy or pharyngolaryngectomy. Of these, nine underwent stapler-assisted laryngectomy; seven of the nine patients underwent concurrent stapler-assisted laryngectomy, cricopharyngeal myotomy and a hybrid tracheoesophageal puncture procedure. These seven patients were the focus of this review. Successful voicing and oral alimentation was achieved in all patients. Mean time to phonation was 30 days (range, 7-77 days) and mean time to first valve change was 90 days (range, 35-117 days). CONCLUSION: Primary tracheoesophageal puncture with concurrent voice prosthesis placement and cricopharyngeal myotomy is easily performed with stapler-assisted laryngectomy. The hybrid tracheoesophageal puncture procedure is a simple method that enables a single operator to achieve primary tracheoesophageal puncture and valve placement; in addition, it facilitates concurrent cricopharyngeal myotomy.},

abstract = {The strict definition of the Ramsay Hunt syndrome is peripheral facial nerve palsy accompanied by an erythematous vesicu- lar rash on the ear (zoster oticus) or in the mouth. J Ramsay Hunt, who described various clinical presentations of facial paralysis and rash, also recognised other frequent symptoms and signs such as tin- nitus, hearing loss, nausea, vomiting, ver- tigo, and nystagmus. He explained these eighth nerve features by the close proxim- ity of the geniculate ganglion to the vestibulocochlear nerve within the bony facial canal. Hunt's analysis of clinical variations of the syndrome now bearing his name led to his recognition of the gen- eral somatic sensory function of the facial nerve and his defining of the geniculate zone of the ear. It is now known that vari- cella zoster virus (VZV) causes Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Compared with Bell's palsy (facial pa- ralysis without rash), patients with Ram- say Hunt syndrome often have more severe paralysis at onset and are less likely to recover completely. Studies suggest that treatment with prednisone and acyclovir may improve outcome, although a pro- spective randomised treatment trial re- mains to be undertaken. In the only prospective study ofpatients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome, 14{\%} developed vesicles after the onset of facial weakness. Thus, Ramsay Hunt syndrome may initially be indistinguishable from Bell's palsy. Fur- ther, Bell's palsy is significantly associated with herpes simplex virus (HSV) infec- tion. In the light of the known safety and eVectiveness of antiviral drugs against VZV or HSV, consideration should be given to early treatment of all patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome or Bell's palsy with a 7–10 day course offamciclovir (500 mg, three times daily) or acyclovir (800 mg, five times daily), as well as oral prednisone (60 mg daily for 3–5 days). Finally, some patients develop periph- eral facial paralysis without ear or mouth rash, associated with either a fourfold rise in antibody to VZV or the presence ofVZV DNA in auricular skin, blood mononu- clear cells, middle ear fluid, or saliva. This indicates that a proportion of patients with “Bell's palsy” have Ramsay Hunt syndrome zoster sine herpete. Treatment of these patients with acyclovir and pred- nisone within 7 days of onset has been shown to improve the outcome ofrecovery from facial palsy.},

True paralysis and paresis result from vocal fold denervation secondary to injury to the laryngeal or vagus nerve. Vocal fold paresis or paralysis may be unilateral or bilateral, central or peripheral, and it may involve the recurrent laryngeal nerve, superior laryngeal nerve, or both. The physician's first responsibility in any case of vocal fold paresis or paralysis is to confirm the diagnosis and be certain that the laryngeal motion impairment is not caused by arytenoid cartilage dislocation or subluxation, cricoarytenoid arthritis or ankylosis, neoplasm, or other mechanical causes. Strobovideolaryngoscopy, endoscopy, radiologic and laboratory studies, and electromyography are all useful diagnostic tools. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The associated co-morbid diseases present at the time of discovery of adult maturity-onset diabetes mellitus have not hitherto been quantitatively related to the subsequent course of the patients. From existing medical records and other solicited data, complete 5-yr follow-up was obtained for an 'inception cohort' of 188 patients who were treated during the years 1959-1962 at the West Haven VA Hospital and whose diabetes was first diagnosed within 6 months before 'zero time', which was the date of discharge for the ailment that had provoked hospitalization. A special classification was developed for categorizing the zero-time co-morbidity of the patients as prognostically cogent or non-cogent, and for dividing cogent co-morbidity into vascular and nonvascular types, with functional severity graded as none, moderate, and severe. The fatality rate at 5 yr after zero time was 40 per cent (76/188) for all patients, but distinctive gradients of fatality were noted for age, for type of co-morbidity, and particularly for severity of co-morbidity. The 5-yr fatality rate after zero time was 7 per cent in forty-one patients with no cogent co-morbidity, 33 per cent in seventynine patients with moderate co-morbidity and 69 per cent in sixty-eight patients with severe co-morbidity. Of the sixty-eight patients with severe initial co-morbidity, 53 per cent later died of the same or a related ailment; in the seventy-nine patients with moderate co-morbidity, the analogous death rate was 13 per cent. Death was due to 'vascular causes' in 52 per cent of seventy-seven patients who initially had vascular co-morbidity, in 7 per cent of seventy patients with nonvascular co-morbidity, and in 2 per cent of forty-one patients with no cogent co-morbidity. Among 5-yr survivors, the occurrence rate of new vascular events (or 'diabetic complications') was directly related to the same features of age and co-morbidity that seemed to affect fatality. These data indicate that the outcome of patients with maturity-onset diabetes mellitus depends on the type and functional severity of the co-morbid diseases present when the diabetes is detected. An appropriate analysis of co-morbidity, although omitted from existing statistical studies of diabetes, is pre-requisite to evaluating the results of different modes of therapy. {\textcopyright} 1974.},

The only study conducted among women on mouth and pharynx cancer risk, however, reported an inverse association. This study aims to investigate the association between height and the risk of head and neck cancer (HNC) within a large international consortium of HNC. We analyzed pooled individual-level data from 24 case-control studies participating in the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology Consortium. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated separately for men and women for associations between height and HNC risk. Educational level, tobacco smoking, and alcohol consumption were included in all regression models. Stratified analyses by HNC subsites were performed. This project included 17,666 cases and 28,198 controls. We found an inverse association between height and HNC (adjusted OR per 10 cm height = 0.91; 95{\%} CI 5 0.86-0.95 for men; adjusted OR = 0.86; 95{\%} CI 5 0.79-0.93 for women). In men, the estimated OR did vary by educational level, smoking status, geographic area, and control source. No differences by subsites were detected. Adult height is inversely associated with HNC risk. As height can be considered a marker of childhood illness and low energy intake, the inverse association is consistent with prior studies showing that HNC occur more frequently among deprived individuals. Further studies designed to elucidate the mechanism of such association would be warranted.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The mechanisms by which the glucocorticoid dexamethasone produces its therapeutic action in patients with intracranial tumors still remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether dexamethasone affects cerebral perfusion and water molecule diffusion by using quantitative dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion MR imaging (DSC-MR imaging) and diffusion tensor MR imaging (DT-MR imaging). METHODS: Ten consecutive patients with glioblastoma multiforme underwent DSC-MR imaging and DT-MR imaging before and 48-72 hours after dexamethasone treatment (16 mg/day). Cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), mean transit time (MTT), and water mean diffusivity ({\textless}D{\textgreater}) were measured for enhancing tumor, nonenhancing peritumoral edematous brain, and normal-appearing contralateral white matter before and after steroid therapy. The percentage change in CBF, CBV, MTT, and {\textless}D{\textgreater} for the 3 tissue types was calculated for each patient, a mean value obtained for the population, and the statistical significance determined by using a paired-samples Student t test. RESULTS: After dexamethasone treatment, there was no significant change in tumor CBF, CBV, or MTT. Edematous brain CBV and MTT were also unchanged. There was, however, an increase in edematous brain CBF (11.6{\%}; P = .05). {\textless}D{\textgreater} was reduced in both enhancing tumor (-5.8{\%}; P = .001) and edematous brain (-6.0{\%}; P {\textless} .001). There was no significant change in CBF, CBV, MTT, or {\textless}D{\textgreater} for normal-appearing contralateral white matter after treatment. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that dexamethasone does not significantly affect tumor blood flow but may, by reducing peritumoral water content and local tissue pressure, subtly increase perfusion in the edematous brain.},

abstract = {This review focuses on the management of brain metastases. The four main modes of therapy are discussed: whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), surgery, radiosurgery, and chemotherapy. Young patients with limited extracranial disease may benefit from surgical resection of a single brain metastasis, and from radiosurgery (or stereotactic radiotherapy) if two to four brain metastases are present. Whether WBRT after surgery or radiosurgery is beneficial is uncertain. Therefore, two approaches can be justified in patients with a good prognosis: WBRT after surgery or radiosurgery, or alternatively, observation with MRI follow-up after surgery or radiosurgery. A hyperfractionated radiation scheme is then to be preferred to limit late toxicity of WBRT. Patients with extensive extracranial tumour activity or impaired quality of life may benefit from radiosurgery (one to four brain metastases), or from shorter WBRT schedules. We propose a decision tree on the various ways to treat brain metastasis.},

Analogous to the estimand framework recently proposed by the European Medicines Agency for clinical trials, we propose a ‘predictimand' framework of different questions that may be of interest when predicting risk in relation to treatment started after baseline. We provide a formal definition of the estimands matching these questions, give examples of settings in which each is useful and discuss appropriate estimators including their assumptions. We illustrate the impact of the predictimand choice in a dataset of patients with end-stage kidney disease. We argue that clearly defining the estimand is equally important in prediction research as in causal inference.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objectives of the current study were to report the incidence of postoperative complications for salvage total laryngectomy (STL) compared with primary total laryngectomy (PTL) and to identify patient and tumor-related factors predictive of postoperative complications. METHODS: A sample of 183 patients who had received a total laryngectomy were identified from an existing database of 662 patients treated for squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx. PTL and STL were performed in 113 and 70 patients, respectively. Initial therapy in the patients who required salvage surgery included radiotherapy (RT) in 32 (46{\%}) and chemoradiotherapy (CTRT) in 38 (54{\%}). Postoperative complications were recorded for each group and categorized into local, swallowing, airway, and systemic complications. Postoperative complication rates for STL after RT and CTRT were compared with those after PTL by univariate analysis. Patient and tumor-related predictors of complications were identified by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The overall mortality rate was 0.5{\%}. Forty percent of all patients developed a postoperative complication after total laryngectomy. Local complications, which were the most frequent, occurred in 52 (28{\%}) patients. Pharyngocutaneous fistula occurred in 31 (17{\%}) patients. Statistical analysis showed that there was a greater number of patients with local wound (45{\%} vs. 25{\%}, P = 0.02) and fistula complications (32{\%} vs. 12{\%}, P = 0.012) in the STL-CTRT group compared with the primary laryngectomy group. Multivariate analysis showed that primary CTRT was an independent predictor of local complications and pharyngocutaneous fistula. CONCLUSIONS: Salvage laryngectomy was more frequently associated with postoperative complications after CTRT compared with PTL. Problems related to local wound healing, especially the development of pharyngocutaneous fistula, constituted the most common postoperative complication in these patients. Multivariate analysis showed that primary CTRT was an independent predictor of local wound complications and pharyngocutaneous fistula.},

abstract = {Objective: To investigate the nature of public preferences in the allocation of donor liver grafts for transplantation. Design: A qualitative study based upon the transcripts of four focus groups. Setting: Derby, Derbyshire, UK. Participants: Twenty-two members of the public in the Derby locality, recruited to one of four focus groups through local community groups. Main Outcome Measures: The views of focus group members as to the importance (or otherwise) of several potential discriminating factors which could be used in the prioritization of patients on the waiting list for liver transplantation were ascertained. The factors included were expected posttransplantation prognosis, the age of the patient, whether the patient was personally responsible for their illness, the time spent on the waiting list, re-transplantation or primary transplant and the social background of the patient. Results and Conclusions: Group members explored the criteria from a number of perspectives, and made some unexpected link-ages between the criteria and wider moral principles. They did not come to firm conclusions about the relative desirability of the criteria, but their approach was notably flexible and thoughtful, with the exception of a few instances where they appeared to resort to arguments based on what is 'obvious' and 'natural'. The results of these discussions suggest that members of the public would be able and willing to respond positively to a more open and consultative system of donor liver prioritization than exists presently within the UK.},

abstract = {Background Aims Early allograft dysfunction (EAD) following liver transplantation (LT) negatively impacts graft and patient outcomes. The Liver Graft Assessment Following Transplantation (L-GrAFT7) risk-score estimates 3-month graft-failure-free survival (area under the receiver operator characteristic [AUROC] curve=0.83), and was superior to the binary EAD (AUROC=0.68) definition and Model for Early Allograft Function (MEAF, AUROC=0.70) in the single-center derivation cohort (DC, n=2008). We sought to externally validate L-GrAFT7, and compare its prognostic performance to EAD and MEAF. Methods Accuracies of L-GrAFT7, EAD, and MEAF were compared in a 3-center US validation cohort (VC, n=3201), and Consortium for Organ Preservation in Europe (COPE) normothermic machine perfusion trial cohort (n=222), with comparison of characteristics to assess generalizability. Results Compared to the DC, VC and COPE patients had lower recipient median MELD scores (18 and 14 vs 31); were less likely to require pretransplant hospitalization (23.3{\%} and 0{\%} vs 46.1{\%}), renal replacement therapy (8.8{\%} and 1.8{\%} vs 31.7{\%}), mechanical ventilation (3.7{\%} and 0{\%} vs 19.8{\%}); and had superior 1-year overall (90{\%} and 95{\%} vs 84{\%}) and graft-failure-free (88{\%} and 93{\%} vs 81{\%}) survival, with a lower incidence of 3-month graft failure (7.4{\%} and 4.0{\%} vs. 11.1{\%}; P7 maintained an excellent validation AUROC of 0.78, significantly superior to the EAD (AUROC=0.68, P=0.001) and MEAF scores (AUROC=0.72, P7 was significantly associated with time to liver allograft (HR 2.17, P=0.016) and Clavien ≥IIIB (HR 2.60, P=0.034) and ≥IVa (HR 4.99, P=0.011) complications, and post-LT length of hospitalization (P=0.002) and renal replacement therapy (OR 3.62, P=0.016). Conclusions We have validated the L-GrAFT7 risk score as a generalizable, highly accurate, individualized risk assessment of 3-month liver allograft failure that is superior to the existing EAD and MEAF scores. L-GrAFT7 may standardize grading of early hepatic allograft function, and serve as a clinical end-point in translational studies aiming to mitigate ischemia-reperfusion injury. Lay Summary Early allograft dysfunction negatively affects outcomes following liver transplantation (LT). In independent multicenter US and European cohorts totaling 3423 patients undergoing LT, the Liver Graft Assessment Following Transplantation (L-GrAFT) risk score is validated as a superior measure of early allograft function that accurately discriminates 3-month graft failure free survival and post-LT complications.},

The aim of the current study was to review the pertinent literature and discuss the optimal management of early-stage laryngeal carcinoma. Literature review indicated that the local control, laryngeal preservation, and survival rates of patients were similar after transoral laser resection, open partial laryngectomy, and radiotherapy. Voice quality depended on the extent of resection for patients undergoing surgery; results for patients undergoing laser resection for limited lesions were comparable to the corresponding results for patients receiving radiotherapy, whereas open partial laryngectomy yielded poorer results. Costs were similar for laser resection and radiotherapy, but open partial laryngectomy was more expensive. Patients with well defined lesions suitable for transoral laser excision with a good functional outcome were treated with either laser or radiotherapy. The remaining patients were optimally treated with radiotherapy. Open partial laryngectomy was reserved for patients with locally recurrent tumors.},

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort study. PATIENTS: 63 patients following total laryngectomy using valved speech. INTERVENTION: University of Washington Quality of Life (UW-QOL) questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient perception of the QOL over the last 7 days following total laryngectomy in response to specific questions and correlated with sociodemographic and treatment factors. RESULTS: Responses were received from 44 males and 11 females (response rate: 87.3{\%}) with a median age of 66 years (range: 40-84). The mean (SD) composite score of the QOL in our series of patients with total laryngectomy was 81.3 (10.9). As regards the overall QOL, 80{\%} of our patients cited it as very good (45.5{\%}) to good (34.5{\%}). Patients identified speech, appearance, and activity as the most important issues following total laryngectomy. Only age and pharyngo-oesophageal segment closure were significant predictors of QOL scores (Student t test, p {\textless} 0.05) and not other demographic and treatment variables. CONCLUSIONS: The composite score and overall QOL were high in our series of total laryngectomy patients and this possibly reflects adequate multidisciplinary management. We strongly urge the use of prospective longitudinal studies that will adequately identify any QOL changes over time. Although the UW-QOL questionnaire is a simple and brief scale, it has limitations that can curtail its effective use in laryngectomy patients and we advise supplementing it with the use of domain-specific questionnaires.},

abstract = {Gore-Tex has been used as an effective implant for medialization laryngoplasty in the management of paralytic dysphonia; however, reporting of large patient cohorts has been limited. Furthermore, the use of Gore-Tex in the treatment of glottal incompe- tence secondary to soft tissue defects has not yet been described. Finally, a number of the procedural nuances of using Gore-Tex have not been elucidated. Aprospective investigation was done on 142 patients who underwent 152 Gore-Tex medialization laryngoplas- ties in 183 vocal folds from December 1997 to March 2002. The primary diagnoses prompting the 152 procedures were paralysis in 94, paresis in 18, cancer reconstruction in 14, sulcus vocalis in 6, atrophy in 3, trauma defect in 5, arytenoid dislocation in 3, bilateral paralysis in 3, bilateral paresis in 1, parkinsonism in 4, and neurologic aerodynamic dissociation in I. One patient who underwent reconstruction of a complex cancer defect required endoscopic removal of the Gore-Tex because of persistent granulation. Clinical observations reveal that Gore-Tex is a versatile implant that is ideally suited for phonosurgical reconstruction of aerodynamic glottal incompetence secondary to a variety of causes. Gore-Tex was especially useful for medialization of complex anatomic soft tissue defects such as those resulting from cancer resection, trauma, atrophy, and sulcus vocalis. There was superior ease in handling, placement, and in vivo adjustability.},

Since the end of the 1990s, multiple unfruitful attempts have been made to reach a consensus, including the Dejonckere protocol for the European Laryngological Society in 2001. This suggested to perform objective and quantifiable measures in the following domains: perception, acoustic, aerody- namic, self-evaluation by the patient and videolaryngostroboscopy. But in a PubMed{\textregistered} search with the keywords “Voice Assessment” and “Voice Outcome” since 2001 retrieving 452 articles, only 33 of them were using methods taking into account the first four dimensions proposed by Dejonckere. To elaborate a new and simpler protocol, we chose to focus on unilateral vocal fold paralyses (UVFP), which represents a homogeneous disease in terms of physiology. This protocol was elaborated on the basis of a review of the literature and of the database and experience of the IFOS panel members. In summary, our group recommends the use and implementation of the ELS “basic protocol” with some minor modifications. Voice audio recordings are an indispensable prerequisite, and may even have medico-legal implications. We recommend the systematic use of the Voice Handicap Index (VHI). Perceptual analysis must be per- formed by using Hirano's GRB scale and voice breathiness has to be prioritized. Currently, acoustic analysis remains optional given the lack of data to support clinical usefulness. Aerodynamic studies should include at a minimum an evaluation of the Maximum Phonation Time, calculated in seconds following multiple trials in order to obtain a recording representing the patient's best possible glottis closure.},

abstract = {Voice perturbation measures, such as jitter and shimmer, depend on accurate extraction of fundamental frequency (Fo) and amplitude of various waveform types. The extraction method directly affects the accuracy of the measures, particularly if several waveform types (with or without formant structure) are under consideration and if noise and modulation are present in the signal. For frequency perturbation, high precision is defined here as the ability to extract Fo to +/- 0.01{\%} under conditions of noise and modulation. Three Fo-extraction methods and their software implementations are discussed and compared. The methods are cycle-to-cycle waveform matching, zero-crossing and peak-picking. Interpolation between samples is added to make the extractions more accurate and reliable. The sensitivity of the methods to different parameters such as sampling frequency, mean Fo, signal-to-noise ratio, frequency modulation, and amplitude modulation are explored.},

abstract = {Objective Calibrated risk models are vital for valid decision support. We define four levels of calibration and describe implications for model development and external validation of predictions. Study Design and Setting We present results based on simulated data sets. Results A common definition of calibration is "having an event rate of R{\%} among patients with a predicted risk of R{\%}," which we refer to as "moderate calibration." Weaker forms of calibration only require the average predicted risk (mean calibration) or the average prediction effects (weak calibration) to be correct. "Strong calibration" requires that the event rate equals the predicted risk for every covariate pattern. This implies that the model is fully correct for the validation setting. We argue that this is unrealistic: the model type may be incorrect, the linear predictor is only asymptotically unbiased, and all nonlinear and interaction effects should be correctly modeled. In addition, we prove that moderate calibration guarantees nonharmful decision making. Finally, results indicate that a flexible assessment of calibration in small validation data sets is problematic. Conclusion Strong calibration is desirable for individualized decision support but unrealistic and counter productive by stimulating the development of overly complex models. Model development and external validation should focus on moderate calibration.},

abstract = {After the introduction of catheter intervention for atrial septal defect (ASD) in the pediatric population, therapeutic advantages of this less invasive procedure were focused on adult through geriatric populations. The most valuable clinical benefits of this procedure are the significant improvement of symptoms and daily activities, which result from the closure of left to right shunt without thoracotomy and cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. These benefits contribute to increase the number of adult patients of this condition who have hesitated over surgical closure. In terms of technical point of view for catheter closure of ASD, the difficulties still exist in some morphological features of defect, or hemodynamic features in the adult population. Morphological features of difficult ASD closure are (1) large (≥30mm) ASD, (2) wide rim deficiency, and (3) multiple defects. Hemodynamic features of difficult ASD are (1) severe pulmonary hypertension, (2) ventricular dysfunction, and (3) restrictive left ventricular compliance (diastolic dysfunction) after ASD closure. To complete the catheter ASD closure under these difficult conditions, various procedural techniques have been introduced. These are new imaging modalities such as real-time three-dimensional imaging, new technical modifications, and new concepts for hemodynamic evaluation. Especially, real-time three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography can provide the high quality imaging for anatomical evaluation including maximum defect size, surrounding rim morphology, and the relationship between device and septal rim. In adult patients, optimal management for their comorbidities is an important issue, which includes cardiac function, atrial arrhythmias, respiratory function, and renal function. Management of atrial arrhythmias is a key issue for the long-term outcome in adult patients. Because the interventional procedures are not complication-free techniques, the establishment of a surgical back-up system is essential for the safe achievement of the procedure. Finally, the establishment of a team approach including pediatric and adult cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, and anesthesiologists is the most important factor for a good therapeutic outcome.},

abstract = {GOALS OF WORK: To document the use of steroids and frequency of their side effects in patients with brain metastases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A survey of oncologists who manage patients with brain metastases was conducted to document steroid prescribing practice in our institution. In addition, a retrospective chart review of 88 patients treated with whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), identified through the Palliative Radiation Oncology Program database, was conducted for a 6-month period to documents steroid doses prescribed, tapering schedules, and steroid side effects. RESULTS: Ninety percent of physicians responded to the survey. Forty-five percent routinely used dexamethasone 4 mg qid (16 mg/day). The others determined the dose of steroid according to the presence or absence of neurological symptoms. Sixty percent tapered the patient's steroids over the 4 weeks following completion of WBRT. The most common side effects noted by physicians were: increased appetite or weight gain (46{\%}), insomnia (24{\%}), gastro-intestinal symptoms (20{\%}). In the retrospective study, dexamethasone 4 mg qid was prescribed to 52{\%} patients prior and during WBRT. Sixty-six percent of patients were instructed to taper dexamethasone after WBRT, but details were not provided. The most frequently documented steroid-related side effects were: increased appetite (32{\%}), proximal muscle weakness (28{\%}), and insomnia (21{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable variation in the prescribing practices even within a single institution, with many patients receiving high dose of steroids for considerable periods of time and developing related side effects. Strategies to reduce the amount and length of steroids may result in improved therapeutic ratio; we are currently accruing onto such a trial.},

abstract = {The debate about the best approach to select patients with hepatocellular cancer (HCC) waiting for liver transplantation (LT) is still ongoing. This study aims to identify the best variables allowing to discriminate between “high-” and “low-benefit” patients. To do so, the concept of intention-to-treat (ITT) survival benefit of LT has been created. Data of 2,103 adult HCC patients consecutively enlisted during the period 1987-2015 were analyzed. Three rigorous statistical steps were used in order to create the ITT survival benefit of LT: the development of an ITT LT and a non-LT survival model, and the individual prediction of the ITT survival benefit of LT defined as the difference between the median ITT survival with (based on the first model) and without LT (based on the second model) calculated for each enrolled patient. Four variables (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, alpha-fetoprotein, Milan-Criteria status, and radiological response) displayed a high effect in terms of delta benefit. According to these risk factors, four benefit groups were identified. Patients with three to four factors (“no-benefit group”; n = 405 of 2,103; 19.2{\%}) had no benefit of LT compared to alternative treatments. Conversely, patients without any risk factor (“large-benefit group”; n = 108; 5.1{\%}) yielded the highest benefit from LT reaching 60 months. Conclusion: The ITT transplant survival benefit presented here allows physicians to better select HCC patients waiting for LT. The obtained stratification may lead to an improved and more equitable method of organ allocation. Patients without benefit should be de-listed, whereas patients with large benefit ratio should be prioritized for LT. (Hepatology 2017;66:1910–1919).},

We hypothesized that organ procurement organizations (OPOs) may differ in exception practices, use of exceptions may be increasing over time, and exception patients may be advantaged relative to other patients. We analyzed longitudinal MELD score, exception and outcome in 88 981 adult liver candidates as reported to the United Network for Organ Sharing from 2002 to 2010. Proportion of patients receiving an HCC exception was 0-21.4{\%} at the OPO-level and 11.9-18.8{\%} at the region level; proportion receiving an exception for other conditions was 0.0{\%} -13.1{\%} (OPOlevel) and 3.7-9.5 (region-level).

Isolated human laryngeal structures (n = 104) from individuals between the ages of 15 and 89 were removed at autopsy and radiographically examined. The cricoid and individual regions of the thyroid cartilage were scored according to degree of ossification, and the relationship between age and degree of ossification statistically examined. A previously published study on age-determination from thyroid ossification by Cern{\'{y}} was assessed for accuracy. The results of the study indicate that although a consistent sequence in the ossification of laryngeal structures exists, variations in timing does not permit narrow age range estimates. Consequently the method presented by Cern{\'{y}} is inaccurate and should not be used in the forensic setting.},

Objective—The Copenhagen Facial Nerve Study aims to explain the spontaneous course of idiopathic peripheral facial nerve palsy which occurs without any kind of treatment. In this study Bell's palsy and idiopathic palsy are considered to be synonymous and specify an acute, monosymptomatic, unilateral peripheral facial paresis of unknown etiology. Material and methods —The material includes 2,570 cases of peripheral facial nerve palsy studied during a period of 25 years. It includes 1,701 cases of Bell's palsy and 869 of non-Bell's palsy. In the total patient sample, 116 had herpes zoster, 76 were diabetic, 46 were pregnant and 169 were neonates. A total of 38 different etiologies were observed. At the rst consultation a standard ENT examination was performed, including a thorough description of the grade and localization of the paresis, taste, stapedius re ex and nasolacrimal re ex tests and acoustic-vestibular examination. Follow-up was done once a week during the rst month and subsequently once a month until normal function was restored or for up to 1 year. Results —The initial examination revealed 30{\%} incomplete and 70{\%} complete palsies. Follow-up showed that in 85{\%} of patients function was returned within 3 weeks and in the remaining 15{\%} after 3 – 5 months. In 71{\%} of patients normal mimical function was obtained. Sequelae were slight in 12{\%} of patients, mild in 13{\%} and severe in 4{\%}. Contracture and associated movements were found in 17{\%} and 16{\%} of patients, respectively. Conclusion — A survey of the literature showed that no kind of treatment, including prednisone, was able to give a better prognosis. The use of prednisone raises a big ethical problem because no evidence of its ef cacy exists and the euphoric side-effect induces a false feeling of bene t in the patients.},

abstract = {Survival analysis is a collection of statistical procedures for data analysis where the outcome variable of interest is time until an event occurs. Because of censoring - the nonobservation of the event of interest after a period of follow-up - a proportion of the survival times of interest will often be unknown. It is assumed that those patients who are censored have the same survival prospects as those who continue to be followed, that is, the censoring is uninformative. Survival data are generally described and modelled in terms of two related functions, the survivor function and the hazard function. The survivor function represents the probability that an individual survives from the time of origin to some time beyond time t. It directly describes the survival experience of a study cohort, and is usually estimated by the KM method. The logrank test may be used to test for differences between survival curves for groups, such as treatment arms. The hazard function gives the instantaneous potential of having an event at a time, given survival up to that time. It is used primarily as a diagnostic tool or for specifying a mathematical model for survival analysis. In comparing treatments or prognostic groups in terms of survival, it is often necessary to adjust for patient-related factors that could potentially affect the survival time of a patient. Failure to adjust for confounders may result in spurious effects. Multivariate survival analysis, a form of multiple regression, provides a way of doing this adjustment, and is the subject the next paper in this series.},

These guidelines supersede the prior 2007 guidelines and 2009 updates.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS:Members of the writing committee were appointed by the American Stroke Association Stroke Council's Scientific Statement Oversight Committee, representing various areas of medical expertise. Strict adherence to the American Heart Association conflict of interest policy was maintained throughout the consensus process. Panel members were assigned topics relevant to their areas of expertise, reviewed the stroke literature with emphasis on publications since the prior guidelines, and drafted recommendations in accordance with the American Heart Association Stroke Council's Level of Evidence grading algorithm.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS:The goal of these guidelines is to limit the morbidity and mortality associated with stroke. The guidelines support the overarching concept of stroke systems of care and detail aspects of stroke care from patient recognition; emergency medical services activation, transport, and triage; through the initial hours in the emergency department and stroke unit. The guideline discusses early stroke evaluation and general medical care, as well as ischemic stroke, specific interventions such as reperfusion strategies, and general physiological optimization for cerebral resuscitation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS:Because many of the recommendations are based on limited data, additional research on treatment of acute ischemic stroke remains urgently needed.},

abstract = {Meningiomas are the second-most common intracranial tumours in adults. They are derived from the arachnoid cells, and although approximately 90{\%} of meningiomas are benign, more than half of all meningiomas develop peritumoral brain oedema (PTBE), which increases morbidity. The PTBE can be treated with steroid therapy, but this treatment is not specific, is not always effective, and involves long-term side-effects. Meningiomas are treated with radiation therapy, stereotactic radio-surgery or surgical resection. At the moment surgical resection is the only definite treatment, and the removal of the tumour also removes the PTBE. Based on the localization of the meningioma, surgery can be complicated. Although PTBE around meningiomas is frequent, the mechanisms behind its development are not clearly understood. It is believed that due to tumour growth and local tissue hypoxia, angiogenesis is increased and leads to the formation of PTBE. The angiogenic protein vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) is believed to be involved in the formation of PTBE around meningiomas, as several studies have found that it is increased in meningiomas with PTBE. VEGF-A is also known as vascular permeability factor due to its ability to increase the permeability of capillaries. Paper I examines the VEGF-A protein and mRNA levels in 101 intracranial meningiomas. The PTBE is quantified on MRI, and capillary length and tumour water content are measured and compared to control brain tissue. Possible co-factors to PTBE like meningioma localization and subtypes are also examined. Forty-three of the patients have primary, solitary, supratentorial meningiomas with PTBE. The correlation between PTBE or edema index with the VEGF-A protein and mRNA, capillary length, and tumour water content is investigated in these patients. A novel method is used for mRNA quantification. It involves direct amplification of the mRNA with probes and branched DNA in order to produce a chemiluminescence signal that can be measured using a luminometer. The paper shows that the oedema index is correlated to the VEGF-A protein and mRNA, and that capillary length is correlated to the PTBE. It also finds that VEGF-A protein and mRNA, capillary length and water content is increased in meningiomas compared to control tissue, suggesting that VEGF-A is produced in, and possibly secreted from the meningiomas. In addition, supratentorial meningiomas are shown to have larger PTBE compared to infratentorial meningiomas, suggesting that infratentorial meningiomas are diagnosed and removed earlier, due to earlier symptom development based on the anatomical features of the fossa posterior. Finally, a gender-specific difference in tumour water content and VEGF-A protein is revealed (higher and lower in females, respectively). Paper II is a method-comparison study pitting the chemiluminescence assay against the often used quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay. In RT-qPCR, RNA is isolated, measured, reverse transcribed, purified, amplified via real-time PCR, and analyzed. The method is robust and reliable, albeit laborious to some extent. The chemiluminescence assay detects RNA directly without the need for RNA purification, complement DNA synthesis or cyclic amplification. By comparing the output of the two protocols to a dilution series ranging from 1 to 128 times of the homogenized samples, the precision of the protocols is measured. Furthermore, VEGF-A/GAPDH ratios are quantified for 15 tissue samples and the results compared between the two protocols, showing significant correlation. The study finds that the chemiluminescence assay is competitive to RT-qPCR, and reflects a similar pattern in gene expression measurement with a similar precision. Whether one method or the other should be used depends on the variability of the samples, budget, and time. RT-qPCR has a much wider dynamic range, and is preferable in case of significant sample inter-variability. It is also less expensive, and gives the user more flexibility as homemade reagents can be used. On the other hand, the chemiluminescence assay is straight forward, requires less hands-on-time, and can be used on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. Paper III continues the investigations in paper I. The sample size is increased so that 22 angiomatous and secretory meningiomas are compared to 40 non-angiomatous meningiomas and 10 control brain tissue samples. Angiomatous and secretory meningiomas are chosen because they are known to have larger PTBE compared to other meningiomas. In addition to VEGF-A, capillary length, and PTBE, the VEGF-A tyrosine kinase receptor VEGFR-2 mRNA and protein levels are also examined. VEGFR-2 is a transmembrane receptor found on endothelial cells. It binds VEGF-A and thereby increases angiogenesis. VEGFR-2's co-receptor neuropilin-1 is also examined. Neuropilin-1 is an agonist of angiogenesis through complex-binding of VEGF-A, but it can also work as an inhibitor through competitive binding of semaphorin-3A. The complex binding of semaphorin-3A to neuropilin-1 can also induce endothelial cell apoptosis, thus working as an antagonist of angiogenesis. The study finds that VEGF-A mRNA, VEGF-A protein, and neuropilin-1 mRNA are higher in angiomatous and non-angiomatous meningiomas compared to controls. VEGFR-2 protein is higher, and neuropilin-1 protein lower in angiomatous meningiomas compared to controls. The mean capillary length is 3614 mm/mm3 in angiomatous, 605 mm/mm3 in non-angiomatous meningiomas, and 229 mm/mm3 in the controls. Non-angiomatous and angiomatous meningioma patients have equally sized tumours. The mean PTBE around the angiomatous meningiomas is 695 cm3, i.e. 477 cm3 larger than the non-angiomatous meningiomas (p = 0.0045), and the mean oedema index is twice the size compared to the non-angiomatous meningiomas. Further comparison between the two meningioma groups shows that mean VEGF-A mRNA, VEGFR-2 protein, and neuropilin-1 mRNA is significantly higher and neuropilin-1 protein is lower in the angiomatous meningiomas. We believe that the VEGF-A pathway participates in the formation of PTBE in meningiomas by inducing formation of "leaky" capillaries, resulting in secretion of VEGF-A and plasma to the peritumoural brain tissue. It may therefore be worth pursuing therapies targeted directly against VEGF-A and its receptors through drugs like bevacizumab, sorafenib, sunitifib, and cediranib.},

abstract = {Background: The recent progress in medical research generates an increasing interest in the use of longitudinal biomarkers for characterizing the occurrence of an outcome. The present work is motivated by a study, where the objective was to explore the potential of the long pentraxin 3 (PTX3) as a prognostic marker of Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD) after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Time-varying covariate Cox model was commonly used, despite its limiting assumptions that marker values are constant in time and measured without error. A joint model has been developed as a viable alternative; however, the approach is computationally intensive and requires additional strong assumptions, in which the impacts of their misspecification were not sufficiently studied. Methods: We conduct an extensive simulation to clarify relevant assumptions for the understanding of joint models and assessment of its robustness under key model misspecifications. Further, we characterize the extent of bias introduced by the limiting assumptions of the time-varying covariate Cox model and compare its performance with a joint model in various contexts. We then present results of the two approaches to evaluate the potential of PTX3 as a prognostic marker of GvHD after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Results: Overall, we illustrate that a joint model provides an unbiased estimate of the association between a longitudinal marker and the hazard of an event in the presence of measurement error, showing improvement over the time-varying Cox model. However, a joint model is severely biased when the baseline hazard or the shape of the longitudinal trajectories are misspecified. Both the Cox model and the joint model correctly specified indicated PTX3 as a potential prognostic marker of GvHD, with the joint model providing a higher hazard ratio estimate. Conclusions: Joint models are beneficial to investigate the capability of the longitudinal marker to characterize time-to-event endpoint. However, the benefits are strictly linked to the correct specification of the longitudinal marker trajectory and the baseline hazard function, indicating a careful consideration of assumptions to avoid biased estimates.},

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort study. PATIENTS: 63 patients following total laryngectomy using valved speech. INTERVENTION: University of Washington Quality of Life (UW-QOL) questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient perception of the QOL over the last 7 days following total laryngectomy in response to specific questions and correlated with sociodemographic and treatment factors. RESULTS: Responses were received from 44 males and 11 females (response rate: 87.3{\%}) with a median age of 66 years (range: 40-84). The mean (SD) composite score of the QOL in our series of patients with total laryngectomy was 81.3 (10.9). As regards the overall QOL, 80{\%} of our patients cited it as very good (45.5{\%}) to good (34.5{\%}). Patients identified speech, appearance, and activity as the most important issues following total laryngectomy. Only age and pharyngo-oesophageal segment closure were significant predictors of QOL scores (Student t test, p {\textless} 0.05) and not other demographic and treatment variables. CONCLUSIONS: The composite score and overall QOL were high in our series of total laryngectomy patients and this possibly reflects adequate multidisciplinary management. We strongly urge the use of prospective longitudinal studies that will adequately identify any QOL changes over time. Although the UW-QOL questionnaire is a simple and brief scale, it has limitations that can curtail its effective use in laryngectomy patients and we advise supplementing it with the use of domain-specific questionnaires.},

abstract = {Context: In February 2002, the allocation system for liver transplantation became based on the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. Before MELD, black patients were more likely to die or become too sick to undergo liver transplantation compared with white patients. Little information exists regarding sex and access to liver transplantation. Objective: To determine the association between race, sex, and liver transplantation following introduction of the MELD system. Design, Setting, and Patients: A retrospective cohort of black and white patients (≥18 years) registered on the United Network for Organ Sharing liver transplantation waiting list between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2000 (pre-MELD cohort, n=21 895) and between February 28, 2002, and March 31, 2006 (post-MELD cohort, n=23 793). Main Outcome Measures: Association between race, sex, and receipt of a liver transplant. Separate multivariable analyses evaluated cohorts within each period to identify predictors of time to death and the odds of dying or receiving liver transplantation within 3 years of listing. Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were analyzed separately. Results: Black patients were younger (mean [SD], 49.2 [10.7] vs 52.4 [9.2] years; P{\textless}.001) and sicker (MELD score at listing: median [interquartile range], 16 [12-22] vs 14 [11-19]; P{\textless}.001) than white patients on the waiting list for both periods. In the pre-MELD cohort, black patients were more likely to die or become too sick for liver transplantation than white patients (27.0{\%} vs 21.7{\%}) within 3 years of registering on the waiting list (odds ratio [OR], 1.51; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 1.15-1.98; P=.003). In the post-MELD cohort, black race was no longer associated with increased likelihood of death or becoming too sick for liver transplantation (26.5{\%} vs 22.0{\%}, respectively; OR, 0.96; 95{\%} CI, 0.74-1.26; P=.76). Black patients were also less likely to receive a liver transplant than white patients within 3 years of registering on the waiting list pre-MELD (61.6{\%} vs 66.9{\%}; OR, 0.75; 95{\%} CI, 0.59-0.97; P=.03), whereas post-MELD, race was no longer significantly associated with receipt of a liver transplant (47.5{\%} vs 45.5{\%}, respectively; OR, 1.04; 95{\%}CI, 0.84-1.28; P=.75).

Similarly, women were less likely than men to receive a liver transplant within 3 years both pre-MELD (64.8{\%} vs 67.6{\%}; OR, 0.80; 95{\%} CI, 0.70-0.92; P=.002) and post-MELD (39.9{\%} vs 48.7{\%}; OR, 0.70; 95{\%} CI, 0.62-0.79; P{\textless}.001). Conclusion: Following introduction of the MELD score to the liver transplantation allocation system, race was no longer associated with receipt of a liver transplant or death on the waiting list, but disparities based on sex remain. {\textcopyright}2008 American Medical Association.

abstract = {The early postoperative hypopharyngeal anatomy of 37 consecutive patients undergoing total laryngectomy at the Boston Veteran's Administration Hospital between July 1977 and April 1980 was studied by barium swallow radiographs and correlated with the technique of closure. The "pseudoepiglottis," a structure radiographically resembling a normal epiglottis, was seen arising from the anterior hypopharynx near the base of the tongue in 21 of 28 evaluable patients. It occurred in all patients with vertical closures vs. 67{\%} of patients with a "T" shaped closure. The average length in the "T" closure group was 9.6 mm (range 0-35) vs. 18.4 mm (6-40) in the vertical group, a statistically significant difference (p less than 0.05). Radiologic strictures occurred in 39{\%} of all patients, dysphagia in 29{\%}, fistulae in 18{\%}, and sinus tracts in 14{\%}. All complications occurred more frequently in the vertical closure group. Patients who received preoperative cis-platinum bleomycin chemotherapy and postoperative irradiation had 50{\%} dysphagia and 67{\%} stricture rates. The average ratio of the width of the retropharyngeal space to that of C4 was 0.48 in stricture patients vs. 0.29 in non-stricture patients (statistically significant at the p less than 0.01 level). This ratio taken in the early postoperative period may help predict which patients will develop strictures},

abstract = {This year was notable for changes to exception points determined by the geographic median allocation Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) and implementation of the National Liver Review Board, which took place on May 14, 2019. The national acuity circle liver distribution policy was also implemented but reverted to donor service area- and region-based boundaries after 1 week. In 2019, growth continued in the number of new waiting list registrations (12,767) and transplants performed (8,896), including living-donor transplants (524). Compared with 2018, living-donor liver transplants increased 31{\%}. Women continued to have a lower deceased­donor transplant rate and a higher pretransplant mortality rate than men. The median waiting time for candidates with a MELD of 15-34 decreased, while the number of transplants performed for patients with exception points decreased. These changes may have been related to the policy changes that took effect in May 2019, which increased waiting list priority for candidates without exception status. Hepatitis C continued to decline as an indication for liver transplant, as the proportion of liver transplant recipients with alcohol-related liver disease and clinical profiles consistent with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis increased. Graft and patient survival have improved despite changing recipient demographics including older age, higher MELD, and higher prevalence of obesity and diabetes.},

abstract = {With the implementation of the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), refractory ascites, a known predictor of mortality in cirrhosis, was removed as a criterion for liver allocation. Because ascites is associated with low serum sodium, we evaluated serum sodium as an independent predictor of mortality in patients with cirrhosis who were listed for liver transplantation and whether the addition of serum sodium to MELD was superior to MELD alone. This is a single-center retrospective cohort of all adult patients with cirrhosis listed for transplantation from February 27, 2002, to December 26, 2003. Listing laboratories were those nearest the listing date ±2 months. Of the 513 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 341 were still listed, while 172 were removed from the list (105 for transplantation, 56 for death, 11 for other reasons). The median serum sodium and MELD scores were 137 mEq/L (range, 110-155) and 15 (range, 6-51), respectively, at listing. Median follow-up was 201 (range, 1-662) days. The risk of death with serum sodium {\textless} 126 mEq/L at listing or while listed was increased, with hazard ratios of 7.8 (P {\textless} .001) and 6.3 (P {\textless} .001), respectively, and the association was independent of MELD. The c-statistics of receiver operating characteristic curves for predicting mortality at 3 months based upon listing MELD with and without listing serum sodium were 0.883 and 0.897, respectively, and at 6 months were 0.871 and 0.905, respectively. In conclusion, serum sodium {\textless} 126 mEq/L at listing or while listed for transplantation is a strong independent predictor of mortality. Addition of serum sodium to MELD increases the ability to predict 3- and 6-month mortality in patients with cirrhosis.},

abstract = {In German legislation and in Eurotransplant's practice of liver allocation, urgency of need is considered as the primary distribution criterion. However, at a certain stage, the "sickest-first" principle is regarded as counterproductive as the performance status of these patients receiving an organ is on average critical and mortality and morbidity after liver transplantation increase. Within the medical transplant community, the criterion of prospect for success is highly accepted. As clinicians having a certain scope in decision-making as "gatekeepers" in regard to which patient gets on the waiting list and at which stage a patient is defined as "not transplantable" and as transplantation centers aspire good success rates, the goal of high prospect for success might become more weighty than intended by legislation and professional guidelines. From an ethical point of view, it is submitted a so-called mediatory approach in between the two extremes "sickest-first" and "fittest-first." Beyond that, it is argued for further development of a prognostic score for post-operative outcome after liver transplantation - as long as questions of social justice are borne in mind - to support "objective" decision-making. 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons A/S.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A group of 104 patients (56 male, 48 female) with voice complaints completed the VHI twice with a mean interval of 13 days. RESULTS: There were no differences in scores between male and female patients. There was a good correlation between the first and the second measurement (r=0.95). The difference between two VHI scores of any one patient and the total score were not related. We found that a 14-point difference in total score of the Dutch VHI for 1 patient at two points in time is significant. CONCLUSION: The Dutch version of the VHI has a good reproducibility. When used for clinical evaluation studies of patients with voice complaints, a difference of 14 points between two measurements is significant.},

abstract = {Famciclovir is a guanine analog antiviral drug used commonly for herpes zoster. Efficacy of famciclovir treatment has been reported to be comparable to valacyclovir treatment. Both of these medications reduce the time to complete cessation of zoster-associated pain including post-herpetic neuralgia, as compared to acyclovir. We conducted a multicenter, randomized, open clinical trial in order to evaluate the extent of pain relief afforded by these two antiviral drugs during the acute disease phase of herpes zoster. The study group comprised 86 immunocompetent adult patients suffering from herpes zoster, who were treated with either famciclovir or valacyclovir for 7 days. Of these, 55 patients enrolled in this study within 72 h of the onset of the rash and 31 patients after 72 h of the onset. There was a significant reduction in acute herpes zoster pain with famciclovir on day 7 and at 2-3 weeks in both of these patient groups, while with valacyclovir, there was not significant reduction in pain on day 7. Of patients aged 50 years or older, there was a significantly earlier reduction in pain with famciclovir than with valacyclovir. In addition, a significant reduction in the number of patients with pain was observed as early as days 3-4 with famciclovir treatment as compared with valacyclovir treatment.

abstract = {Background: Before considering whether to use a multivariable (diagnostic or prognostic) prediction model, it is essential that its performance be evaluated in data that were not used to develop the model (referred to as external validation). We critically appraised the methodological conduct and reporting of external validation studies of multivariable prediction models. Methods. We conducted a systematic review of articles describing some form of external validation of one or more multivariable prediction models indexed in PubMed core clinical journals published in 2010. Study data were extracted in duplicate on design, sample size, handling of missing data, reference to the original study developing the prediction models and predictive performance measures. Results: 11,826 articles were identified and 78 were included for full review, which described the evaluation of 120 prediction models. in participant data that were not used to develop the model. Thirty-three articles described both the development of a prediction model and an evaluation of its performance on a separate dataset, and 45 articles described only the evaluation of an existing published prediction model on another dataset. Fifty-seven percent of the prediction models were presented and evaluated as simplified scoring systems. Sixteen percent of articles failed to report the number of outcome events in the validation datasets. Fifty-four percent of studies made no explicit mention of missing data. Sixty-seven percent did not report evaluating model calibration whilst most studies evaluated model discrimination. It was often unclear whether the reported performance measures were for the full regression model or for the simplified models. Conclusions: The vast majority of studies describing some form of external validation of a multivariable prediction model were poorly reported with key details frequently not presented. The validation studies were characterised by poor design, inappropriate handling and acknowledgement of missing data and one of the most key performance measures of prediction models i.e. calibration often omitted from the publication. It may therefore not be surprising that an overwhelming majority of developed prediction models are not used in practice, when there is a dearth of well-conducted and clearly reported (external validation) studies describing their performance on independent participant data. {\textcopyright} 2014 Collins et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

After isolation and expansion, cells were identified as adherent mesenchymal cells with substantial proliferation potential invitro, and were also characterized by flow cytometry. The differentiation potential of mesenchymal cells was maintained during proliferation as confirmed by culturing for adipogenesis, osteogenesis and chondrocyte.

abstract = {Several epidemiological studies have shown a positive association between adult height and cancer incidence. The only study conducted among women on mouth and pharynx cancer risk, however, reported an inverse association. This study aims to investigate the association between height and the risk of head and neck cancer (HNC) within a large international consortium of HNC. We analyzed pooled individual-level data from 24 case-control studies participating in the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology Consortium. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated separately for men and women for associations between height and HNC risk. Educational level, tobacco smoking, and alcohol consumption were included in all regression models. Stratified analyses by HNC subsites were performed. This project included 17,666 cases and 28,198 controls. We found an inverse association between height and HNC (adjusted OR per 10 cm height = 0.91; 95{\%} CI 5 0.86-0.95 for men; adjusted OR = 0.86; 95{\%} CI 5 0.79-0.93 for women). In men, the estimated OR did vary by educational level, smoking status, geographic area, and control source. No differences by subsites were detected. Adult height is inversely associated with HNC risk. As height can be considered a marker of childhood illness and low energy intake, the inverse association is consistent with prior studies showing that HNC occur more frequently among deprived individuals. Further studies designed to elucidate the mechanism of such association would be warranted.},

abstract = {In renal transplantation, serum creatinine (SCr) is the main biomarker routinely measured to assess patient's health, with chronic increases being strongly associated with long-term graft failure risk (death with a functioning graft or return to dialysis). Joint modeling may be useful to identify the specific role of risk factors on chronic evolution of kidney transplant recipients: some can be related to the SCr evolution, finally leading to graft failure, whereas others can be associated with graft failure without any modification of SCr. Sample data for 2749 patients transplanted between 2000 and 2013 with a functioning kidney at 1-year post-transplantation were obtained from the DIVAT cohort. A shared random effect joint model for longitudinal SCr values and time to graft failure was performed. We show that graft failure risk depended on both the current value and slope of the SCr. Deceased donor graft patient seemed to have a higher SCr increase, similar to patient with diabetes history, while no significant association of these two features with graft failure risk was found. Patient with a second graft was at higher risk of graft failure, independent of changes in SCr values. Anti-HLA immunization was associated with both processes simultaneously. Joint models for repeated and time-to-event data bring new opportunities to improve the epidemiological knowledge of chronic diseases. For instance in renal transplantation, several features should receive additional attention as we demonstrated their correlation with graft failure risk was independent of the SCr evolution.},

To evaluate prospectively the prevalence of low serum sodium concentration and the association between serum sodium levels and severity of ascites and complications of cirrhosis, prospective data were collected on 997 consecutive patients from 28 centers in Europe, North and South America, and Asia for a period of 28 days. The prevalence of low serum sodium concentration as defined by a serum sodium concentration ≤135 mmol/L, ≤130 mmol/L, ≤125 mmol/L, and ≤120 mmol/L was 49.4{\%}, 21.6{\%}, 5.7{\%}, and 1.2{\%}, respectively. The prevalence of low serum sodium levels ( {\textless} 135 mmol/L) was high in both inpatients and outpatients (57{\%} and 40{\%}, respectively). The existence of serum sodium  {\textless} 135 mmol/L was associated with severe ascites, as indicated by high prevalence of refractory ascites, large fluid accumulation rate, frequent use of large-volume paracentesis, and impaired renal function, compared with normal serum sodium levels. Moreover, low serum sodium levels were also associated with greater frequency of hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and hepatorenal syndrome, but not gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with serum sodium  {\textless} 130 mmol/L had the greatest frequency of these complications, but the frequency was also increased in patients with mild reduction in serum sodium levels (131-135 mmol/L).

These rates were influenced primarily by the extent of surgery and the type of reconstruction, which during this interval included primary closure, pectoralis major myocutaneous flap, or gastric transposition. In comparison to our previous study, when the deltopectoral flap was used for patching the pharynx, the fistula rate for extended laryngectomy has decreased as a result of our use of myocutaneous flaps and greater experience with gastric transposition. Currently, we use the pectoralis major myocutaneous flap for pharyngeal repair if the mucosa would otherwise be closed under tension.

Nurses were more likely to ask if there was a living will and to read it. Only 53{\%} of physicians read living wills; however 90{\%} of physicians consider the wishes in the living will when making recommendations to the family. Physicians were more likely to discuss do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders only when a prognosis was poor.

abstract = {It remains unclear which liver graft reperfusion technique leads to the best outcome following transplantation. An online survey was sent to all transplant centres (n = 37) within Eurotransplant (ET) to collect information on their technique used for reperfusion of liver grafts. Furthermore, a systematic review of all literature was performed and a meta-analysis was conducted based on patients' mortality, number of retransplantations and incidence of biliary complications, depending on the technique used. Of the 28 evaluated centres, 11 (39{\%}) reported performing simultaneous reperfusion (SIMR), 13 (46{\%}) perform initial portal vein reperfusion (IPR), 1 (4{\%}) performs an initial hepatic artery reperfusion (IAR) and 3 (11{\%}) perform retrograde reperfusion (RETR). In 21 centres (75{\%}), one reperfusion technique is used as a standard, but in only one centre is this decision based on available literature. Twenty centres (71{\%}) said they would agree to participate in randomized controlled trials (RCT) if required. For meta-analysis, IAR vs. IPR, SIMR vs. IPR and RETR vs. IPR were compared. There was no difference between any of the techniques compared. There is no consensus on a preferable reperfusion technique. Available evidence does not help in the decision-making process. There is thus an urgent need for multicentric RCTs.{\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors Transplant International {\textcopyright} 2013 European Society for Organ Transplantation.

abstract = {PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to synthesize what is known about the relationship between delay in radiotherapy (RT) and the outcomes of RT.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A systematic review of the world literature was conducted to identify studies that described the association between delay in RT and the probability of local control, metastasis, and/or survival. Studies were classified by clinical and methodologic criteria and their results were combined using a random-effects model.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A total of 46 relevant studies involving 15,782 patients met our minimum methodologic criteria of validity; most (42) were retrospective observational studies. Thirty-nine studies described rates of local recurrence, 21 studies described rates of distant metastasis, and 19 studies described survival. The relationship between delay and the outcomes of RT had been studied in diverse situations, but most frequently in breast cancer (21 studies) and head and neck cancer (12 studies). Combined analysis showed that the 5-year local recurrence rate (LRR) was significantly higher in patients treated with adjuvant RT for breast cancer more than 8 weeks after surgery than in those treated within 8 weeks of surgery (odds ratio [OR] = 1.62, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.21 to 2.16). Combined analysis also showed that the LRR was significantly higher among patients who received postoperative RT for head and neck cancer more than 6 weeks after surgery than among those treated within 6 weeks of surgery (OR = 2.89; 95{\%} CI, 1.60 to 5.21). There was little evidence about the impact of delay in RT on the risk of metastases or the probability of long-term survival in any situation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Delay in the initiation of RT is associated with an increase [corrected] in LRR in breast cancer and head and neck cancer. Delays in starting RT should be as short as reasonably achievable.},

abstract = {Survival analyses are commonly applied to study death or other events of interest. In such analyses, so-called competing risks may form an important problem. A competing risk is an event that either hinders the observation of the event of interest or modifies the chance that this event occurs. For example, when studying death on dialysis, receiving a kidney transplant is an event that competes with the event of interest. Conventional methods for survival analysis ignoring the competing event(s), such as the Kaplan-Meier method and standard Cox proportional hazards regression, may be inappropriate in the presence of competing risks, and alternative methods specifically designed for analysing competing risks data should then be applied. This problem deserves more attention in nephrology research and in the current article, we therefore explain the problem of competing risks in survival analysis and how using different techniques may affect study results.},

abstract = {Background and Aims: Over the last decade, liver transplantation of sicker, older non-hepatitis C cirrhotics with multiple co-morbidities has increased in the United States. We sought to identify an easily applicable set of recipient factors among HCV negative adult transplant recipients associated with significant morbidity and mortality within five years after liver transplantation. Methods: We collected national (n = 31,829, 2002–2015) and center-specific data. Coefficients of relevant recipient factors were converted to weighted points and scaled from 0–5. Recipient factors associated with graft failure included: ventilator support (five patients; hazard ratio [HR] 1.59; 95{\%} CI 1.48–1.72); recipient age {\textgreater}60 years (three patients; HR 1.29; 95{\%} CI 1.23–1.36); hemodialysis (three patients; HR 1.26; 95{\%} CI 1.16–1.37); diabetes (two patients; HR 1.20; 95{\%} CI 1.14–1.27); or serum creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dl without hemodialysis (two patients; HR 1.15; 95{\%} CI 1.09–1.22). Results: Graft survival within five years based on points (any combination) was 77.2{\%} (0–4), 69.1{\%} (5–8) and 57.9{\%} ({\textgreater}8). In recipients with {\textgreater}8 points, graft survival was 42{\%} (model for end-stage liver disease [MELD] score {\textless}25) and 50{\%} (MELD score 25–35) in recipients receiving grafts from donors with a donor risk index {\textgreater}1.7. In center-specific data within the first year, subjects with ≥5 points (vs. 0–4) had longer hospitalization (11 vs. 8 days, p {\textless}0.01), higher admissions for rehabilitation (12.3{\%} vs. 2.7{\%}, p {\textless}0.01), and higher incidence of cardiac disease (14.2{\%} vs. 5.3{\%}, p {\textless}0.01) and stage 3 chronic kidney disease (78.6{\%} vs. 39.5{\%}, p = 0.03) within five years. Conclusion: The impact of co-morbidities in an MELD-based organ allocation system need to be reassessed. The proposed clinical tool may be helpful for center-specific assessment of risk of graft failure in non-HCV patients and for discussion regarding relevant morbidity in selected subsets. Lay summary: Over the last decade, liver transplantation of sicker, older patient with multiple co-morbidities has increased. In this study, we show that a set of recipient factors (recipient age {\textgreater}60 years, ventilator status, diabetes, hemodialysis and creatinine {\textgreater}1.5 mg/dl) can help identify patients that may not do well after transplant. Transplanting sicker organs in patients with certain combinations of these characteristics leads to lower survival.},

We sought to combine the recent experience of multiple high-volume institutions, with different reconstructive preferences, in the management of pharyngeal closure technique for post-radiation therapy salvage total laryngectomy in an effort to bring clarity to this clinical challenge.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: To determine if the use of vascularized flaps in either an onlay or interposed fashion reduces the incidence or duration of pharyngocutaneous fistula after salvage laryngectomy compared with simple primary closure of the pharynx.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN: Multi-institutional retrospective review of all patients undergoing total laryngectomy after having received definitive radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy between January 2005 and January 2012, conducted at 7 academic medical centers.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSETTING: Academic, tertiary referral centers.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPATIENTS: The study population comprised 359 patients from 8 institutions. All patients had a history of laryngeal irradiation and underwent laryngectomy between 2005 and 2012. They were grouped as primary closure, pectoralis myofascial onlay flap, or interposed free tissue. All patients had a minimum of 4 months follow-up.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Fistula incidence, severity, and predictors of fistula.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Of the 359 patients, fistula occurred in 94 (27{\%}). For patients with fistula, hospital stay increased from 8.9 to 12.1 days (P {\textless} .001) and oral diet initiation was delayed from 10.5 days to 29.9 days (P {\textless} .001). Patients were grouped according to closure technique: primary closure (n = 99), pectoralis onlay flap (n = 40), and interposed free tissue (n = 220). Incidence of fistula with primary closure was 34{\%}. For the interposed free flap group, the fistula rate was lower at 25{\%} (P = .07). Incidence of fistula was the lowest for the pectoralis onlay group at 15{\%} (P = .02). Multivariate analysis confirmed a significantly lower fistula rate with either flap technique. For patients who developed fistula, mean duration of fistula was significantly prolonged with primary closure (14.0 weeks) compared with pectoralis flap (9.0 weeks) and free flap (6.5 weeks).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Pharyngocutaneous fistula remains a significant problem following salvage laryngectomy. Use of nonirradiated, vascularized flaps reduced the incidence and duration of fistula and should be considered during salvage laryngectomy.},

abstract = {Clinical prediction models (CPMs) are often used to guide treatment initiation, with individuals at high risk offered treatment. This implicitly assumes that the probability quoted from a CPM represents the risk to an individual of an adverse outcome in absence of treatment. However, for a CPM to correctly target this estimand requires careful causal thinking. One problem that needs to be overcome is treatment drop-in: where individuals in the development data commence treatment after the time of prediction but before the outcome occurs. In this issue of the Journal, Xu et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2021;190(10):2000–2014) use causal estimates from external data sources, such as clinical trials, to adjust CPMs for treatment drop-in. This represents a pragmatic and promising approach to address this issue, and it illustrates the value of utilizing causal inference in prediction. Building causality into the prediction pipeline can also bring other benefits. These include the ability to make and compare hypothetical predictions under different interventions, to make CPMs more explainable and transparent, and to improve model generalizability. Enriching CPMs with causal inference therefore has the potential to add considerable value to the role of prediction in healthcare.},

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS The current study report on a retrospective analysis of oncologic outcome of 1050 patients with T1-2N0 glottic cancer treated with radiotherapy. Prospective assessment of quality of life (QoL) and voice handicap index (VHI) was performed in all patients treated from 2006 onwards (n = 233). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Local control (LC), regional control (RC), disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), quality of life and voice handicap index. RESULTS After a median follow-up of 90 months (range 3-309), the actuarial rates of local control, regional control, disease-free survival and overall survival were 85{\%}, 99{\%}, 84{\%} and 81{\%} at 5 years and 82{\%}, 98{\%}, 80{\%} and 61{\%} at 10 years, respectively. On multivariate analysis, T2 tumours, smoking after radiotherapy and conventional radiation scheme correlated significantly with poor local control. Patients who continued smoking after radiotherapy had also significantly lower overall survival rates (OR 4.3, P {\textless} 0.001). Hypothyroidism was reported in 18{\%} of patients. Slight and temporary deterioration of quality of life scores was reported. Patient-reported xerostomia and dysphagia at 48 months were -7.1 and -6.5, compared with baseline, respectively. Voice handicap index improved significantly from 37 at baseline to 18 at 48 months. Patients with T2b and those who continued smoking had significantly worse voice handicap index. CONCLUSIONS In the current study, excellent outcome with good quality of life and voice handicap index scores were reported. T2 tumours, in particular T2b, and continuing smoking after radiotherapy correlated significantly with poor local control and worse voice handicap index.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to quantify peritumoral brain edema (PTE) in vivo using NMR relaxation time imaging, as the longitudinal relaxation time T1 is proportional to tissue water content, and to use the method for monitoring the effects of glucocorticoids (GCCs) on PTE in brain tumor patients as a function of time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Relaxation time imaging (T1 maps) was done on a 1.5 T MR scanner on 23 brain tumor patients [13 cerebral metastases (METs), 10 intracranial meningiomas (MMs), and 9 benign and 1 anaplastic MM] before, and 1, 3, and 7 days after initiation of GCC treatment (dexamethasone 0.26-0.64 mg/kg bw). In addition, 7 patients were studied for 14-63 days of treatment. Imaging analysis included mean T1 of the edema area as a function of time, and an image histogram evaluation technique, which measures 50{\%} of the edema area, where T1 is highest (corresponding to the highest water content of the area), termed the "super-edema." Using a conversion equation, mean T1 in the edema area was recalculated into a percent of tissue water content. RESULTS: After 7 days of GCC treatment total edema area was reduced by 10.3{\%} in the MET patients. The average reduction in mean T1 was 4.6{\%} after 24 h of treatment and 13.5{\%} after 7 days. Expressed in terms of percent tissue water content, the average edema resorption rate in the MET patients was 0.4 +/- 0.1{\%} H2O/day (p {\textless} 0.02). Super-edema area was reduced by 64{\%} after 7 days (p {\textless} 0.0001). None of the benign MMs responded to GCC treatment, either in edema size or in mean T1, unlike the anaplastic type, in which there was a response comparable to that in the MET patients. The effect of GCCs in up to 63 days of treatment is demonstrated. It is shown that after 40-63 days of GCC treatment, PTE water content is close to the upper normal range for white matter. CONCLUSION: PTE is heterogeneous in terms of the spatial distribution of T1 and, thereby, water content. GCCs reduce T1 in PTE around cerebral metastases significantly after a few days of treatment, possibly through a mechanism that reduces edema production below the level of edema resorption. PTE surrounding benign MM was not affected by GCC treatment, contrary to one anaplastic MM, which leads to the speculation that malignant tumors may produce substances that are affected by GCCs and are prerequisites for a GCC effect. Significant reductions in the highest T1 area (super-edema area) were observed after 24 h of treatment. The anti-edema effect of GCC may last at least 63 days. A lower dose-dependent threshold for the effect seems to exist. The possible mechanisms of actions of the GCCs on PTE are discussed.},

This explanation and elaboration document describes the rationale; clarifies the meaning of each item; and discusses why transparent reporting is important, with a view to assessing risk of bias and clinical usefulness of the prediction model. Each checklist item of the TRIPOD Statement is explained in detail and accompanied by published examples of good reporting. The document also provides a valuable reference of issues to consider when designing, conducting, and analyzing prediction model studies. To aid the editorial process and help peer reviewers and, ultimately, readers and systematic reviewers of prediction model studies, it is recommended that authors include a completed checklist in their submission.

abstract = {In nephrology, repeated measures are frequently available (glomerular filtration rate or proteinuria) and linked to adverse outcomes. However, several features of these longitudinal data should be considered before making such inferences. These considerations are discussed, and we describe how joint modeling of repeatedly measured and time-to-event data may help to assess disease dynamics and to derive personalized prognosis. Joint modeling combines linear mixed-effects models and Cox regression model to relate patient-specific trajectory to their prognosis. We describe several aspects of the relationship between time-varying markers and the endpoint of interest that are assessed with real examples to illustrate the aforementioned aspects of the longitudinal data provided. Thus, joint models are valuable statistical tools for study purposes but also may help health care providers in making well-informed dynamic medical decisions.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE We sought to evaluate outcomes and predictors of renal allograft futility (RAF-patient death or need for renal replacement therapy at 3 months) after simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation (SLKT). BACKGROUND Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) prioritization of liver recipients with renal dysfunction has significantly increased utilization of SLKT. Data on renal outcomes after SLKT in the highest MELD recipients are scarce, as are accurate predictors of recovery of native kidney function. Without well-established listing guidelines, SLKT potentially wastes renal allografts in both high-acuity liver recipients at risk for early mortality and recipients who may regain native kidney function. METHODS A retrospective single-center multivariate regression analysis was performed for adult patients undergoing SLKT (January 2004 to August 2014) to identify predictors of RAF. RESULTS Of 331 patients dual-listed for SLKT, 171 (52{\%}) expired awaiting transplant, 145 (44{\%}) underwent SLKT, and 15 (5{\%}) underwent liver transplantation alone. After SLKT, 39{\%} experienced delayed graft function and 20.7{\%} had RAF. Compared with patients without RAF, RAF recipients had greater MELD scores, length of hospitalization, intraoperative base deficit, incidence of female donors, kidney and liver donor risk indices, kidney cold ischemia, and inferior overall survival. Multivariate predictors of RAF included pretransplant dialysis duration, kidney cold ischemia, kidney donor risk index, and recipient hyperlipidemia. CONCLUSIONS With 20{\%} short-term loss of transplanted kidneys after SLKT, our data strongly suggest that renal transplantation should be deferred in liver recipients at high risk for RAF. Consideration for a kidney allocation variance to allow for delayed renal transplantation after liver transplantation may prevent loss of scarce renal allografts.},

We aimed at studying the effect of hyponatremia on cognition, HRQOL, and brain MR spectroscopy (MRS) independent of HE. Methods Four cirrhotic groups (no HE/HN, HE alone, HN alone (sodium {\textless}130 mEq/L), HE + HN) underwent cognitive testing, HRQOL using Sickness Impact Profile (SIP: higher score is worse; has psychosocial and physical sub-scores) and brain MRS (myoinositol (mI) and glutamate + glutamine (Glx)), which were compared across groups. A subset underwent HRQOL testing before/after diuretic withdrawal. Results 82 cirrhotics (30 no HE/HN, 25 HE, 17 HE + HN, and 10 HN, MELD 12, 63{\%} hepatitis C) were included. Cirrhotics with HN alone and without HE/HN had better cognition compared to HE groups (median abnormal tests no-HE/HN: 3, HN: 3.5, HE: 6.5, HE + HN: 7, p = 0.008). Despite better cognition, HN only patients had worse HRQOL in total and psychosocial SIP while both HN groups (with/without HE) had a significantly worse physical SIP (p {\textless}0.0001, all comparisons). Brain MRS showed the lowest Glx in HN and the highest in HE groups (p {\textless}0.02). mI levels were comparably decreased in the three affected (HE, HE + HN, and HN) groups compared to no HE/HN and were associated with poor HRQOL. Six HE + HN cirrhotics underwent diuretic withdrawal which improved serum sodium and total/psychosocial SIP scores. Conclusions Hyponatremic cirrhotics without HE have poor HRQOL despite better cognition than those with concomitant HE. Glx levels were lowest in HN without HE but mI was similar across affected groups. HRQOL improved after diuretic withdrawal. Hyponatremia has a complex, non-linear relationship with brain Glx and mI, cognition and HRQOL. {\textcopyright} 2013 European Association for the Study of the Liver.},

abstract = {CONCLUSIONS: With the cover layer injured, vocal function of mucosal ablation could be protected and even return to normal after surgery and vocal function of mucosal stripping was slightly affected with extensive mucosal injury. Once the body layer was injured, the compensatory mechanism would play an important role in phonation. OBJECTIVES: To investigate voice function following CO2 laser microsurgery for precancerous and early-stage glottic carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Vocal function was examined by acoustic analysis, aerodynamic analysis and videostroboscopic examination. RESULTS: For mucosal ablation, vocal quality recovered 1 month after surgery. For mucosal stripping, although vocal quality was steady 3 months after surgery, slight hoarseness persisted in this group. The contour of the treated fold recovered postoperatively. There were no complications in recovery. For cordectomies, vocal quality became steady 6 months after the surgery. The supraglottal hyperfunction with supraglottal structure squeezing played an important role in phonation. The affected vocal fold mucosal wave was absent instead of a regular ventricular fold wave or mucosal wave of the vocal process during phonation. In comparison with the type III-IV cordectomy, the results of extended cordectomies (type Va and Vc) were worse; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Granulomas and anterior commissure webs were present. All granulomas resolved spontaneously 3 months postoperatively.},

abstract = {Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a subjective measure of patients' experience of disease and treatment. We systematically reviewed the literature to identify high quality manuscripts reporting HRQoL outcomes in adults with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) treated with an organ-sparing curative regimen of radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy. Assessments were performed independently by two reviewers; a third reviewer resolved disputes. High quality reports were reviewed in detail to identify trends in HRQoL outcomes. MEDLINE and EMBASE searching yielded 276 distinct reports, plus 24 added via hand search. Of these, 53 met eligibility criteria and 18 were deemed high quality reports on the basis of a quality assessment tool. HRQoL declines after treatment but recovers to baseline levels, generally within 12 months. However, xerostomia-related HRQoL deficits may remain long-term. Combined chemoradiotherapy showed a trend toward worse HRQoL compared with RT alone. Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) yields better HRQoL compared with conventional or three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. Baseline HRQoL may independently predict local-regional control and overall survival. Future research should incorporate HRQoL into phase III trials. However, adequate effort and journal space must be afforded to the HRQoL results of these studies to ensure proper reporting methods are followed, allowing clinicians to incorporate HRQoL into patient counseling and clinical decision making.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2017 Otology  {\&}  Neurotology, Inc. Objective: To investigate the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including three-dimensional (3D) sequences in the differentiation between Bell's palsy (BP) and Ramsay Hunt syndrome (RHS). Study Design: A prospective study. Setting: Tertiary care center. Patients: Twenty patients: 15 patients with BP and five patients with RHS. Intervention: Diagnostic. Main Outcome Measure: Clinical diagnosis (BP or RHS). Results: The presence of hyperintensity on 3D-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence (3D-FLAIR) and enhancement on gadolinium-enhanced (CE)-3D-FLAIR and CE-3DT1- weighted image (3D-T1WI) along the internal auditory canal (IAC) wall were significantly associated with RHS ( p {\textless} 0.05). Hyperintensity in the inner ear was observed on pre- and postcontrast 3D-FLAIR, and enhancement of the cranial nerve (CN)-VIII was observed only on CE-3DFLAIR. The presence of these findings also showed significant relationships with RHS ( p {\textless} 0.05). Moreover, thickening of the CN-VII in the fundus of the IAC in 3Dconstructive interference on steady state sequence (3D-CISS) also showed a significant association with RHS ( p {\textless} 0.05). In contrast, the presence of hyperintensity of the CN-VII in the fundus of the IAC on 3D-FLAIR did not demonstrate a significant relationship ( p=0.95), and enhancement in this region was observed in all cases on CE-3D-FLAIR and gadolinium-enhanced-three-dimensional-T1-weighted gradient echo sequence (CE-3D-T1WI). Conclusions: 3D MRI sequences are useful for differentiating RHS from BP. In particular, the enhancement in the CNVIII and/or along the IAC wall are valuable findings, and CE-3D-FLAIR is the most useful sequence to evaluate these findings. Thickening of the CN-VII on 3D-CISS is also an important finding.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: The advent of malleable macroporous resorbable plates has allowed the surgeon a greater range of reconstructive options and has decreased the morbidity of conventional plating procedures. Completely malleable after warming to 55 degrees C, resorbable plates can readily conform to most morphologic appearances of fractures or defects and provide rigid fixation when cooled. The plating systems used in head and neck reconstruction are described. STUDY DESIGN: Nine patients were selected for reconstruction using a resorbable plating system. The resorbable system was tested under a variety of clinical situations including frontal sinus fractures (three patients), midface fractures (two patients), mandibular defects (two patients), and laryngeal fractures (two patients). METHODS: Each case was evaluated for rigidity of fixation, and ease of plate contouring and application. Furthermore, the postoperative functional and cosmetic results and complications were contrasted between the resorbable plating systems and each surgeon's vast experience with traditional plating systems. RESULTS: The resorbable plating system was found to be as effective as traditional plating systems with respect to rigidity of fixation, functional results, and complications. In addition, the resorbable system was far easier to contour and, consequently, to apply, while producing higher cosmetic satisfaction after plate resorption than traditional plating. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our experience, resorbable plates appear to be safe, easy to contour and apply, as well as effective for a wide range of head and neck reconstructive applications. In addition, the shortcomings of permanently retained plates such as plate migration, bone growth restriction, and imaging artifact are avoided.},

abstract = {Background and Aims: Patients with cirrhosis on the liver transplant (LT) waiting list may die or be removed because of complications of portal hypertension (PH) or infections. von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF-Ag) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are simple, broadly available markers of these processes. Approach and Results: We determined whether addition of vWF-Ag and CRP to the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-Sodium (MELD-Na) score improves risk stratification of patients awaiting LT. CRP and vWF-Ag at LT listing were assessed in two independent cohorts (Medical University of Vienna [exploration cohort] and Mayo Clinic Rochester [validation cohort]). Clinical characteristics, MELD-Na, and mortality on the waiting list were recorded. Prediction of 3-month waiting list mortality was assessed by receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC-AUC). In order to explore potential mechanisms underlying the prognostic utility of vWF-Ag and CRP in this setting, we evaluated their association with PH, bacterial translocation, systemic inflammation, and circulatory dysfunction. In the exploration cohort (n = 269) vWF-Ag and CRP both improved the predictive value of MELD-Na for 3-month waitlist mortality and showed the highest predictive value when combined (AUC: MELD-Na, 0.764; MELD-Na + CRP, 0.790; MELD-Na + vWF, 0.803; MELD-Na + CRP + vWF-Ag, 0.824). Results were confirmed in an independent validation cohort (n = 129; AUC: MELD-Na, 0.677; MELD-Na + CRP + vWF-Ag, 0.882). vWF-Ag was independently associated with PH and inflammatory biomarkers, whereas CRP closely, and MELD independently, correlated with biomarkers of bacterial translocation/inflammation. Conclusions: The addition of vWF-Ag and CRP—reflecting central pathophysiological mechanisms of PH, bacterial translocation, and inflammation, that are all drivers of mortality on the waiting list for LT—to the MELD-Na score improves prediction of waitlist mortality. Using the vWFAg-CRP-MELD-Na model for prioritizing organ allocation may improve prediction of waitlist mortality and decrease waitlist mortality.},

abstract = {Background: Postoperative infections are a costly and morbid complication. The introduction of perioperative infection prevention bundles have decreased surgical site infections (SSIs) in patients undergoing colorectal and pancreatic surgery. Aim: The purpose of this study was to determine if the implementation of a perioperative bundle would reduce postoperative infectious complications in patients undergoing hepatic surgery. Methods: An evidence-based, low cost, perioperative infection bundle was created, and a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database was performed on 163 consecutive patients undergoing hepatic surgery. Patient characteristics, operative details, outcomes, and complications were reviewed, and differences pre- and post-bundle were assessed with univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: A total of 113 patients received standard infection prophylaxis, while 50 received the perioperative bundle. Twenty-five patients had infections (16 deep abscesses, 3 superficial SSIs, 4 urinary tract infections, 1 pneumonia, 1 bacteremia). The overall infection rate decreased from 20.4 {\%} (23/133) pre-bundle to 4 {\%} (2/50) post-bundle. The SSI rate also decreased from 15 {\%} (17/113) to 4 {\%} (2/50). Univariate analysis showed that institution of the bundle was associated with a lower overall infection rate (p = 0.008), lower SSI rate (p = 0.06), and lower overall complication rate (p = 0.04). Multivariate analysis confirmed that the use of the bundle was independently associated with a lower infection (p = 0.008) and SSI (p = 0.05) rate. The primary length of stay (LOS) and LOS for 60 days postoperatively both significantly decreased post-bundle (from median of 5–4 days, p ≤ 0.001; 6–4 days, p ≤ 0.001). Conclusions: Implementation of a perioperative infection prevention bundle significantly decreased overall infections, SSIs, and postoperative LOS in patients undergoing hepatic surgery. {\textcopyright} 2015, Society of Surgical Oncology.},

abstract = {Currently, patients awaiting deceased-donor liver transplantation are prioritized by medical urgency. Specifically, wait-listed chronic liver failure patients are sequenced in decreasing order of Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. To maximize lifetime gained through liver transplantation, posttransplant survival should be considered in prioritizing liver waiting list candidates. We evaluate a survival benefit based system for allocating deceased-donor livers to chronic liver failure patients. Under the proposed system, at the time of offer, the transplant survival benefit score would be computed for each patient active on the waiting list. The proposed score is based on the difference in 5-year mean lifetime (with vs. without a liver transplant) and accounts for patient and donor characteristics. The rank correlation between benefit score and MELD score is 0.67. There is great overlap in the distribution of benefit scores across MELD categories, since waiting list mortality is significantly affected by several factors. Simulation results indicate that over 2000 life-years would be saved per year if benefit-based allocation was implemented. The shortage of donor livers increases the need to maximize the life-saving capacity of procured livers. Allocation of deceased-donor livers to chronic liver failure patients would be improved by prioritizing patients by transplant survival benefit.},

abstract = {Objective: To compare the short-term speech success of voice prosthesis (VP) among patients who underwent total laryngectomy or total laryngectomy in combination with neck dissection and those who received postoperative radiotherapy. Materials and Methods: Thirty-two male patients treated for laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma were included. Nine patients underwent total laryngectomy and 23 underwent total laryngectomy combined with neck dissection, and 17 of the 23 with neck dissection were managed with postoperative radiotherapy (45-75 Gy). All of the patients had indwelling intraoperative placement of the Provox VP (Atos Medical AB, Horby, Sweden; and Entermed BV, Woerden, The Netherlands) at the time of the primary tracheoesophageal puncture (TEP) completed in conjunction with total laryngectomy. Patients with pharyngoesophageal myotomy and pharyngeal plexus neurectomy were excluded. Patients' speech success was perceptually evaluated 3-4 weeks after the surgery and 3-4 weeks after the cessation of radiotherapy, using a 1-3 scale (1 = failure to develop speech (aphonia); 2 = communicate with short phrases only; and 3 = communicate with fluency and long sentences). Results: No complications were noted with intraoperative prosthesis placement. No prostheses were dislodged in the postoperative period. Eighteen of 32 patients (56{\%}) demonstrated successful speech (rating of 3). Nine patients (28{\%}) demonstrated less successful speech (rating of 2). Five patients (16{\%}) were found to be aphonic (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Of the nine patients who underwent total laryngectomy only, six were found to have successful speech (66.6{\%}), one (11.1{\%}) was found to have less successful speech quality, and two (22.2{\%}) patients were aphonic (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Of the six patients who underwent total laryngectomy in combination with neck dissection, three had successful speech (50{\%}), one (16.6{\%}) had less successful speech, and two (33.3{\%}) were aphonic (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Of the 17 patients who received postoperative radiotherapy, nine (52.9{\%}) had successful speech, three (17.6{\%}) had less successful speech, and five (29.4{\%}) were aphonic (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Conclusion: Neck dissection and postoperative radiotherapy have no significant influence on short-term speech success in VP restoration patients. Primary TEP should be preferred in patients who have laryngectomy in combination with neck dissection and/or will have postoperative radiation therapy, as it provides early and successful voice restoration without interfering with radiation treatment and avoids a second surgical intervention. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Voice Foundation.},

abstract = {Purpose of Review To give an overview of the evolvement of transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) in the treatment of early glottic carcinoma and highlight the contribution of recent literature. Recent Findings The indications and limits of TLM have been well specified. Effects on swallowing have been well documented. Introduction of narrow-band imaging (NBI) and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance has been shown of additional value for outcome. The first reports on transoral robotic surgery show that it may be of added value in the future. Summary TLM for early glottic carcinoma (Tis–T2) has very good oncological outcomes with indications of higher larynx preservation in TLM than that in radiotherapy. The anterior commissure is a risk factor if involved in the cranio-caudal plane, and reduced vocal fold mobility is a risk factor when this is due to arytenoid involvement. The best voice results are achieved when the anterior commissure can be left intact along with part of the vocal fold muscle although even in larger resections, patient self-reported voice handicap is still limited.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of transoral laser microsurgery for early glottic cancer on subjective and objective vocal outcome measures. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary care cancer centre. PARTICIPANTS: All patients scheduled for transoral laser microsurgery for untreated early primary glottic cancer over a 22-month period and offered voice assessment (31 patients; 19 tumour stage one, 12 tumour stage two). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fundamental frequency, maximum phonation time, calculated jitter, shimmer and subjective voice rating, analysed by tumour stage. RESULTS: Tumour stage T1 patients had significantly different fundamental frequencies and maximum phonation times at three months post-operatively, compared with pre-operative values; these differences resolved by 12 months. At 12 months, tumour stage T2 patients had significantly shorter maximum phonation times, and all patients reported significantly worse subjective voice ratings, compared with pre-operative values. CONCLUSION: We found no change in fundamental frequency, jitter and shimmer, one year post-operatively. Maximum phonation time deteriorated but stage one patients appeared to compensate, whereas stage two patients did not. Resection size may be a factor. All patients reported significantly worse subjective voice ratings at one year. Aerodynamic and subjective voice measures appear most sensitive to change in this patient group.},

abstract = {Several epidemiological studies have shown a positive association between adult height and cancer incidence. The only study conducted among women on mouth and pharynx cancer risk, however, reported an inverse association. This study aims to investigate the association between height and the risk of head and neck cancer (HNC) within a large international consortium of HNC. We analyzed pooled individual-level data from 24 case-control studies participating in the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology Consortium. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated separately for men and women for associations between height and HNC risk. Educational level, tobacco smoking, and alcohol consumption were included in all regression models. Stratified analyses by HNC subsites were performed. This project included 17,666 cases and 28,198 controls. We found an inverse association between height and HNC (adjusted OR per 10 cm height = 0.91; 95{\%} CI 5 0.86-0.95 for men; adjusted OR = 0.86; 95{\%} CI 5 0.79-0.93 for women). In men, the estimated OR did vary by educational level, smoking status, geographic area, and control source. No differences by subsites were detected. Adult height is inversely associated with HNC risk. As height can be considered a marker of childhood illness and low energy intake, the inverse association is consistent with prior studies showing that HNC occur more frequently among deprived individuals. Further studies designed to elucidate the mechanism of such association would be warranted.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: Hyponatremia is associated with reduced survival in patients with cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation. However, it is not known whether hyponatremia also represents a risk factor of poor outcome after transplantation. We aimed to assess the effects of hyponatremia at the time of transplantation on posttransplantation outcome in patients with cirrhosis. Methods: Two-hundred forty-one consecutive patients with cirrhosis submitted to liver transplantation during a 4-year period (January 2000-December 2003) were included in the study. The main end point was survival at 3 months after transplantation. Secondary end points were complications within the first month after transplantation. Results: Patients with hyponatremia (serum sodium lower than 130 mEq/L) had a greater incidence of neurologic disorders, renal failure, and infectious complications than patients without hyponatremia (odds ratio; 4.6, 3.4 and 2.7, respectively) within the first month after transplantation. By contrast, hyponatremia was not associated with an increased incidence of severe intra-abdominal bleeding, acute rejection, or vascular and biliary complications. Hyponatremia was an independent predictive factor of early posttransplantation survival. Three-month survival of patients with hyponatremia was 84{\%} compared with 95{\%} of patients without hyponatremia (P {\textless} .05). Survival was similar after 3 months. Conclusions: In patients with cirrhosis, the presence of hyponatremia is associated with a high rate of neurologic disorders, infectious complications, and renal failure during the first month after transplantation and reduced 3-month survival. In cirrhosis, hyponatremia should be considered not only a risk factor of death before transplantation but also a risk factor of impaired early posttransplantation outcome. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Gastroenterological Association Institute.},

abstract = {Adoption of the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) to select and prioritize patients for liver transplantation represented a turning point in organ allocation. Prioritization of transplant recipients switched from time accrued on the waiting list to the principle of "sickest first". The MELD score incorporates three simple laboratory parameters (serum creatinine and bilirubin, and INR for prothrombin time) and stratifies patients according to their disease severity in an objective and continuous ranking scale. Concordance statistics have demonstrated its high accuracy in stratifying patients according to their risk of dying in the short-term (three months). Further validations of MELD as a predictor of survival at various temporal end-points have been obtained in independent patient cohorts with a broad spectrum of chronic liver disease. The MELD-based liver graft allocation policy has led to a reduction in waitlist new registrations and mortality, shorter waiting times, and an increase in transplants, without altering overall graft and patient survival rates after transplantation. MELD limitations are related either to the inter-laboratory variability of the parameters included in the score, or to the inability of the formula to predict mortality accurately in specific settings. For some conditions, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, widely accepted MELD corrections have been devised. For others, such as persistent ascites and hyponatremia, attempts to improve MELD's predicting power are currently underway, but await definite validation. {\textcopyright} 2010 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

abstract = {The objective of this study was to characterize the relationship between gentamicin concentrations during surgery and the development of wound infection following colorectal operations. Despite decades of research in surgical prophylaxis, the relationship between intraoperative antibiotic concentrations and postoperative infection and the concentrations required for effective prophylaxis have not been established. A pharmacodynamic analysis was conducted using data from a previous prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical study which compared two dosage regimens of gentamicin plus metronidazole for prophylaxis in connection with elective colorectal surgery. Univariate and multivariate analyses of risk factors for postoperative wound infection were conducted, and the relationship between intraoperative gentamicin concentrations and surgical outcome was characterized. The gentamicin concentration at the time of surgical closure was one of the strongest independent risk factors for infection (P = 0.02), along with the presence of diabetes mellitus (P = 0.02), stoma (P = 0.04), and advanced age (P = 0.05). Gentamicin concentrations at closure of less than 0.5 mg/liter were associated with an infection rate of 80{\%} (representing 8 of 10 patients with concentrations below that level) (P = 0.003). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified a critical closure concentration of 1.6 mg/liter for effective surgical prophylaxis (P = 0.002; sensitivity, 70.8{\%}; specificity, 65.9{\%}). This study provides new and important information on antibiotic pharmacodynamics in surgical prophylaxis. It demonstrates the critical effect of the antibiotic concentration at closure on wound infection and suggests a significant association between the concentration and other well-established risk factors, like the timing of preoperative antibiotic administration and surgery duration.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: A persistent insufficiency of glottal closure is mostly a consequence of a unilateral vocal fold movement impairment. It can also be caused by vocal fold atrophy or scarring processes with regular bilateral respiratory vocal fold function. Because of consequential voice, breathing, and swallowing impairments, a functional surgical treatment is required. The goal of the study was to outline the functional results after medialization thyroplasty with the titanium vocal fold medialization implant according to Friedrich. METHODS: In the period of 1999 to 2001, an external vocal fold medialization using the titanium implant was performed on 28 patients (12 women and 16 men). The patients were in the age range of 19 to 84 years. Twenty-two patients had a paralysis of the left-side vocal fold, and six patients, of the right-side vocal fold. Detailed functional examinations were executed on all patients before and after the surgery: perceptive voice sound analysis according to the "roughness, breathiness, and hoarseness" method, judgment of the s/z ratio and voice dysfunction index, voice range profile measurements, videostroboscopy, and pulmonary function tests. In case of dysphagia/aspiration, videofluoroscopy of swallowing was also performed. The respective data were statistically analyzed (paired t test, Wilcoxon-test). RESULTS: All patients reported on improvement of voice, swallowing, and breathing functions postoperatively. Videostroboscopy revealed an almost complete glottal closure after surgery in all of the patients. All voice-related parameters showed a significant improvement. An increase of the laryngeal resistance by the medialization procedure could be excluded by analysis of the pulmonary function test. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the external medialization of the vocal folds as an adequate method in the therapy of voice, swallowing, and breathing impairment attributable to an insufficient glottal closure. The titanium implant offers, apart from good tissue tolerability, the advantage of an easy, time-saving, and individually adjustable application during the operation.},

METHODS: This is a retrospective case series study based at a tertiary center with 31 patients who underwent total laryngectomy between July 2011 and December 2013. Pharyngocutaneous fistula formation after total laryngectomy was evaluated with the patients who underwent modified continuous mucosal Connell suture for pharyngeal repair. RESULTS: Pharyngocutaneous fistula was observed in only one patient (3.2{\%}) who had a history of previous radiotherapy, and it was spontaneously healed within 6 days by conservative treatment. CONCLUSION: We defined a new suture technique for the pharyngeal repair after total laryngectomy. This technique is a simple modification of continuous mucosal Connell suture. We named it as zipper suture. It is effective in the prevention of pharyngocutaneous fistula for pharyngeal reconstruction after total laryngectomy.},

While no statistical difference was found between the three groups in their ability to sustain /s/, the subjects with laryngeal pathology had significantly lower duration times for /z/ than subjects in the other two groups. The computed s/z ratios were significantly higher for the dysphonic subjects with laryngeal pathology; subjects with functional dysphonia free of laryngeal pathology demonstrated the same s/z ratios (approximately 1.0) as the normal-speaking control subjects. The dysphonic subjects with laryngeal pathology produced s/z ratios in excess of 1.4 ninety-five percent of the time. It appeared from these data that when an additive mass developed along the glottal margin, vocal fold approximation was less efficient. This decrement in efficiency appears to result in a decrease in glottal resistance, increasing air flow, and a shortened phonatory duration time. The clinical usefulness of the s/z ratio as a duration measure for identifying voice clients who may have laryngeal lesions is considered.},

abstract = {Deciding who should receive a liver transplant (LT) depends on both urgency and utility. Most survival scores are validated through discriminative tests, which compare predicted outcomes between patients. Assessing post-transplant survival utility is not discriminate, but should be "calibrated" to be effective. There are currently no such calibrated models. We developed and validated a novel calibrated model to predict individual survival after LT for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC). We applied a software tool, PSSP, to adult patients in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (n = 2769) who received a LT for PSC between 2002 and 2013; this produced a model for predicting individual survival distributions for novel patients. We also developed an appropriate evaluation measure, D-calibration, to validate this model. The learned PSSP model showed an excellent D-calibration (p = 1.0), and passed the single-time calibration test (Hosmer-Lemeshow p-value of over 0.05) at 0.25, 1, 5 and 10 years. In contrast, the model based on traditional Cox regression showed worse calibration on long-term survival and failed at 10 years (Hosmer-Lemeshow p value = 0.027). The calculator and visualizer are available at: http://pssp.srv.ualberta.ca/calculator/liver{\_}transplant{\_}2002. In conclusion we present a new tool that accurately estimates individual post liver transplantation survival.},

STUDY DESIGN Prospective clinical trial. SETTING Otolaryngology department, Tanta University Hospital (tertiary referral centre), Egypt. PATIENTS AND METHODS Over five years, 30 patients underwent total laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy to manage stage III or IV laryngeal cancer, followed by primary tracheoesophageal puncture for voice restoration. For neopharyngeal construction, 15 patients underwent pharyngoesophageal myotomy (group one) and 15 cross-over, zigzag neopharyngoplasty (group two). Acoustic parameters of tracheoesophageal voice were compared. RESULTS Most acoustic parameters were almost equivalent for the two groups, although significant differences were seen for loud intensity, dynamic range, shimmer, loud fundamental frequency, loud jitter, fluency and speaking rate. One post-operative pharyngocutaneous fistula (6.6 per cent) occurred in each group, and resolved with conservative measures. CONCLUSION The cross-over neopharyngoplasty modification of hypopharyngeal closure may help avoid pharyngoesophageal spasm and assist maintenance of effective voice amplitude, fundamental frequencies, temporal measures and perceptual values.},

abstract = {Ribosomal and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) comprise numerous modified nucleotides. The modification patterns are retained during evolution, making it even possible to project them from yeast onto human. The stringent conservation of modification sites and the slow evolution of rRNAs and snRNAs contradicts the rapid evolution of small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) sequences. To explain this discrepancy, we investigated the coevolution of snoRNAs and their targeted sites throughout vertebrates. To measure and evaluate the conservation of RNA-RNA interactions, we defined the interaction conservation index (ICI). It combines the quality of individual interaction with the scope of its conservation in a set of species and serves as an efficient measure to evaluate the conservation of the interaction of snoRNA and target. We show that functions of homologous snoRNAs are evolutionarily stable, thus, members of the same snoRNA family guide equivalent modifications. The conservation of snoRNA sequences is high at target binding regions while the remaining sequence varies significantly. In addition to elucidating principles of correlated evolution, we were able, with the help of the ICI measure, to assign functions to previously orphan snoRNAs and to associate snoRNAs as partners to known chemical modifications unassigned to a given snoRNA. Furthermore, we used predictions of snoRNA functions in conjunction with sequence conservation to identify distant homologies. Because of the high overall entropy of snoRNA sequences, such relationships are hard to detect by means of sequence homology search methods alone.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE In total laryngectomy, the neopharynx can be closed in several ways. It is suggested that a pseudo-diverticulum is seen more frequently in patients closed with vertical closure than with "T"-shaped closure, causing postoperative dysphagia. We report the results of patients treated with vertical closure and "T"-shaped closure with regard to the formation of a pseudo-diverticulum and postoperative dysphagia. METHODS In our retrospective cohort study, we identified 117 consecutive laryngectomized patients treated in the VU University Medical Center of Amsterdam between March 2009 and December 2013. Evaluations with statistical analysis of postoperative outcome measures (the formation of a pseudo-diverticulum and dysphagia), qualitative and quantitative variables were conducted. RESULTS Patient demographics were similar between the vertical-shaped closure and the "T"-shaped closure groups. In 84.6{\%} of patients with vertical closure, a pseudo-diverticulum was seen compared to 18.5{\%} with "T"-shaped closure (p {\textless} 0.001). Dysphagia was increasingly seen in patients with a pseudo-diverticulum (60.5{\%}) compared to patients without a pseudo-diverticulum (39.5{\%}) (p = 0.090). CONCLUSION Formation of a pseudo-diverticulum is more frequently seen in laryngectomy patients closed with vertical closure than in patients closed with "T"-shaped closure of the neopharynx. It is favorable to implement "T"-shaped closure in laryngectomy.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims Outcomes of liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are determined by cancer-related and non-related events. Treatments for hepatitis C virus infection have reduced non-cancer events among patients receiving liver transplants, so reducing HCC-related death might be an actionable end point. We performed a competing-risk analysis to evaluate factors associated with survival of patients with HCC and developed a prognostic model based on features of HCC patients before liver transplantation. Methods We performed multivariable competing-risk regression analysis to identify factors associated with HCC-specific death of patients who underwent liver transplantation. The training set comprised 1018 patients who underwent liver transplantation for HCC from January 2000 through December 2013 at 3 tertiary centers in Italy. The validation set comprised 341 consecutive patients who underwent liver transplantation for HCC during the same period at the Liver Cancer Institute in Shanghai, China. We collected pretransplantation data on etiology of liver disease, number and size of tumors, patient level of $\alpha$-fetoprotein (AFP), model for end-stage liver disease score, tumor stage, numbers and types of treatment, response to treatments, tumor grade, microvascular invasion, dates, and causes of death. Death was defined as HCC-specific when related to HCC recurrence after transplantation, disseminated extra- and/or intrahepatic tumor relapse and worsened liver function in presence of tumor spread. The cumulative incidence of death was segregated for hepatitis C virus status. Results In the competing-risk regression, the sum of tumor number and size and of log10 level of AFP were significantly associated with HCC-specific death (P {\textless}.001), returning an average c-statistic of 0.780 (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.763−0.798). Five-year cumulative incidence of non−HCC-related death was 8.6{\%} in HCV-negative patients and 18.1{\%} in HCV-positive patients. For patients with HCC to have a 70{\%} chance of HCC-specific survival 5 years after transplantation, their level of AFP should be {\textless}200 ng/mL and the sum of number and size of tumors (in centimeters) should not exceed 7; if the level of AFP was 200−400 ng/mL, the sum of the number and size of tumors should be ≤5; if their level of AFP was 400−1000 ng/mL, the sum of the number and size of tumors should be ≤4. In the validation set, the model identified patients who survived 5 years after liver transplantation with 0.721 accuracy (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.648{\%}−0.793{\%}). Our model, based on patients' level of AFP and HCC number and size, outperformed the Milan; University of California, San Francisco; Shanghai-Fudan; Up-to-7 criteria (P {\textless}.001); and AFP French model (P =.044) to predict which patients will survive for 5 years after liver transplantation. Conclusions We developed a model based on level of AFP, tumor size, and tumor number, to determine risk of death from HCC-related factors after liver transplantation. This model might be used to select end points and refine selection criteria for liver transplantation for patients with HCC.

abstract = {Children and adults with the most aggressive form of brain cancer, malignant gliomas or glioblastoma, often develop cerebral edema as a life-threatening complication. This complication is routinely treated with dexamethasone (DEXA), a steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with pleiotropic action profile. Here we show that dexamethasone reduces murine and rodent glioma tumor growth in a concentration-dependent manner. Low concentrations of DEXA are already capable of inhibiting glioma cell proliferation and at higher levels induce cell death. Further, the expression of the glutamate antiporter xCT (system Xc-; SLC7a11) and VEGFA is up-regulated after DEXA treatment indicating early cellular stress responses. However, in human gliomas DEXA exerts differential cytotoxic effects, with some human glioma cells (U251, T98G) resistant to DEXA, a finding corroborated by clinical data of dexamethasone non-responders. Moreover, DEXA-resistant gliomas did not show any xCT alterations, indicating that these gene expressions are associated with DEXA-induced cellular stress. Hence, siRNA-mediated xCT knockdown in glioma cells increased the susceptibility to DEXA. Interestingly, cell viability of primary human astrocytes and primary rodent neurons is not affected by DEXA. We further tested the pharmacological effects of DEXA on brain tissue and showed that DEXA reduces tumor-induced disturbances of the microenvironment such as neuronal cell death and tumor-induced angiogenesis. In conclusion, we demonstrate that DEXA inhibits glioma cell growth in a concentration and species-dependent manner. Further, DEXA executes neuroprotective effects in brains and reduces tumor-induced angiogenesis. Thus, our investigations reveal that DEXA acts pleiotropically and impacts tumor growth, tumor vasculature and tumor-associated brain damage.},

abstract = {Separate Cox analyses of all cause-specific hazards are the standard technique of choice to study the effect of a covariate in competing risks, but a synopsis of these results in terms of cumulative event probabilities is challenging. This difficulty has led to the development of the proportional subdistribution hazards model. If the covariate is known at baseline, the model allows for a summarizing assessment in terms of the cumulative incidence function. black Mathematically, the model also allows for including random time-dependent covariates, but practical implementation has remained unclear due to a certain risk set peculiarity. We use the intimate relationship of discrete covariates and multistate models to naturally treat time-dependent covariates within the subdistribution hazards framework. The methodology then straightforwardly translates to real-valued time-dependent covariates. As with classical survival analysis, including time-dependent covariates does not result in a model for probability functions anymore. Nevertheless, the proposed methodology provides a useful synthesis of separate cause-specific hazards analyses. We illustrate this with hospital infection data, where time-dependent covariates and competing risks are essential to the subject research question.},

@article{Merion2003,
abstract = {Liver allocation policy recently was modified to use the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) for patients with chronic liver disease to stratify potential recipients according to risk for waitlist death. In this study, a retrospective cohort of 760 adult patients with chronic liver disease placed on the liver transplant waitlist between January 1995 and March 2001 and followed up for up to 74 months was studied to assess the ability of the MELD to predict mortality among waitlisted candidates and evaluate the prognostic importance of changes in MELD score over time. Serial MELD scores predicted waitlist mortality significantly better than baseline MELD scores or medical urgency status. Each unit of the 40-point MELD score was associated with a 22{\%} increased risk for waitlist death (P {\textless} .001), whereas medical urgency status was not a significant independent predictor. For any given MELD score, the magnitude and direction of change in MELD score during the previous 30 days ($\Delta$MELD) was a significant independent mortality predictor. Patients with MELD score increases greater than 5 points over 30 days had a threefold greater waitlist mortality risk than those for whom MELD scores increased more gradually (P {\textless} .0001). We conclude that mortality risk on the liver transplant waitlist is predicted more accurately by serial MELD score determinations than by medical urgency status or single MELD measurements. $\Delta$MELD score over time reflects progression of liver disease and conveys important additional prognostic information that should be considered in the further evolution of national liver allocation policy.},

abstract = {The predictive value of MELD score for post-transplant survival has been under constant debate since its implementation in 2001. Aim of this study was to assess the impact of alterations in MELD score throughout waiting time (WT) on post-transplant survival. A single-centre retrospective analysis of 1125 consecutive patients listed for liver transplantation between 1997 and 2009 was performed. The impact of MELD score and dynamic changes in MELD score (DeltaMELD), as well as age, sex, year of listing and WT were evaluated on waiting list mortality and post-transplant survival. In this cohort, 539 (60{\%}) patients were transplanted, 223 (25{\%}) died on list and 142 (15{\%}) were removed from the waiting list during WT. One-, three- and five-year survival after liver transplantation were 83{\%}, 78{\%} and 76{\%} respectively. DeltaMELD as a continuous variable proved to be the only significant risk factor for overall survival after liver transplantation (hazard ratio (HR): 1.06, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.1, P = 0.013). The highest risk of post-transplant death could be defined for patients with a DeltaMELD {\textgreater} 10 (HR: 4.87, 95{\%} CI 2.09-11.35, P {\textless} 0.0001). In addition, DeltaMELD as well as MELD at listing showed a significant impact on waiting list mortality. DeltaMELD may provide an easy evaluation tool to identify patients on the liver transplant waiting list with a high mortality risk after transplantation in the current setting. Temporarily withholding and re-evaluating these patients might improve overall outcome after liver transplantation. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {Objectives/Hypothesis: The goal of laryngeal framework surgery in patients with unilateral vocal fold paralysis is to improve glottic closure by medializing the paralyzed vocal fold. Type I thyroplasty (Th) and arytenoid adduction (AA) are two of the most commonly performed procedures. Two of the main rationales for performing an AA are to improve closure of the posterior glottis and correct vertical height discrepancy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if AA with Th yields better posterior glottic closure and vertical height equality than Th alone. Study Design: Retrospective. Methods: Using visual analog scales, three blinded reviewers evaluated glottic closure patterns in patients who underwent Th or Th with AA. Pre- and postoperative videostroboscopic examinations of 45 patients with unilateral vocal fold paralysis, who underwent laryngeal framework surgery, were evaluated. Results: No significant difference was identified in postoperative scores for midmembranous glottis closure (P = 0.282), closure just anterior to the vocal processes (P = 0.426), respiratory glottis closure (P = 0.158), or vertical height discrepancy (P = 0.113). Conclusions: Although larger glottic gaps and vertical height discrepancies may lead some surgeons to predict that an AA is warranted, the usefulness of AA may not always be related to these parameters. Ultimately, voice improvement and not geometry should guide the surgeon's decision making. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Voice Foundation.},

abstract = {Donation after circulatory death (DCD) liver transplantation (LT) may imply a risk for decreased graft survival, caused by post-transplantation complications such as primary non-function or ischemic-type biliary lesions. However, similar survival for DCD and donation after brain death (DBD) LT has been reported. Objective of this study is to determine long-term outcome of DCD LT in the Eurotransplant region corrected for Eurotransplant donor risk index (ET-DRI). Transplants performed in Belgium and The Netherlands (1.1.2003 - 31.12.2007) in adult recipients were included. Graft failure was defined as either date of recipient death or retransplantation; death un-censured graft survival. Mean follow-up was 7.2 years. In total 126 DCD and 1264 DBD LT's were performed. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses showed different graft survival for respectively DBD and DCD at one (78{\%} vs. 75{\%}, p=0.71), five (66{\%} vs. 54{\%}, p=0.02) and ten (47{\%} vs. 44{\%}, p=0.55) years (Log Rank p=0.038). Although there was an overall significant difference, the survival curves almost reach each other after 10 years, most probably caused by lower other risk factors in DCD livers. Patient survival was not significantly different (p=0.59). Multivariate Cox-regression analysis showed a HR 1.7 (p{\textless}0.001) for DCD (corrected for ET-DRI and recipient factors). First warm ischemia time (1st WIT) over 25 minutes was associated with a lower graft survival in univariate analysis of all DCD transplants (p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: DCD LT has an increased risk for diminished graft survival compared to DBD. There was no significant difference in patient survival. DCD allografts with a 1st WIT{\textgreater}25 minutes give an increased risk for decreased graft survival. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of 172 patients who underwent salvage laryngectomy for recurrent carcinoma of the larynx or hypopharynx between 1999 and 2014. One hundred and ten patients underwent primary closure and 62 patients had pectoralis major myofascial flap onlay. RESULTS: The overall pharyngocutaneous fistula rate was 43 per cent, and was similar in both groups (primary closure group, 43.6 per cent; onlay flap group, 41.9 per cent; p = 0.8). Fistulae in the onlay flap group healed faster: the median and mean fistula duration were 37 and 55 days, respectively, in the primary closure group and 20 and 25 days, respectively, in the onlay flap group (p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: Use of an onlay pectoralis major myofascial flap did not decrease the pharyngocutaneous fistula rate, although fistula duration was shortened.

abstract = {In 2014, we reported a model for donor‐recipient (D‐R) matching in liver transplantation (LT) based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) from a Spanish multicenter study (Model for Allocation of Donor and Recipient in Espa{\~{n}}a [MADR‐E]). The aim is to test the ANN‐based methodology in a different European health care system in order to validate it. An ANN model was designed using a cohort of patients from King's College Hospital (KCH; n = 822). The ANN was trained and tested using KCH pairs for both 3‐ and 12‐month survival models. End points were probability of graft survival (correct classification rate [CCR]) and nonsurvival (minimum sensitivity [MS]). The final model is a rule‐based system for facilitating the decision about the most appropriate D‐R matching. Models designed for KCH had excellent prediction capabilities for both 3 months (CCR–area under the curve [AUC] = 0.94; MS‐AUC = 0.94) and 12 months (CCR‐AUC = 0.78; MS‐AUC = 0.82), almost 15{\%} higher than the best obtained by other known scores such as Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease and balance of risk. Moreover, these results improve the previously reported ones in the multicentric MADR‐E database. In conclusion, the use of ANN for D‐R matching in LT in other health care systems achieved excellent prediction capabilities supporting the validation of these tools. It should be considered as the most advanced, objective, and useful tool to date for the management of waiting lists},

abstract = {Objectives To perform a systematic literature review to evaluate the type and timing of therapy for vocal fold paresis/paralysis after thyroidectomy and develop a primary decision-making pathway. Study Design Meta-analysis. Methods Four databases and one journal were searched using the key words of "thyroidectomy," "vocal cord paresis/paralysis," and "therapy." Study quality was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tools. Data regarding type and timing of therapy were extracted from 39 articles. Odds ratios (ORs), relative risk (RR), 95{\%} confidence interval, and heterogeneity were recorded. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the relationships between timing and OR/RR. Results Among the 13 studies investigating unilateral paresis/paralysis, five focused on early therapy (0-6 months). In these studies, the OR for clinical heterogeneity was significantly higher after neurolysis than after injection laryngoplasty and voice training (Q = 17.002, I2 = 78{\%}, P = 0.000), and the RR for heterogeneity was significantly higher after injection laryngoplasty at ≥12 months than {\textless}12 months (Q = 9.984, I2 = 89.9{\%}, P = 0.002). In the 26 studies that investigated bilateral paresis/paralysis, the OR for heterogeneity was significantly higher for bilateral posterior cordectomy than for endolaryngeal laterofixation (Q = 3.510, I2 = 71.5{\%}, P = 0.061) and laser arytenoidectomy with posterior cordectomy (Q = 2.90, I2 = 65.6{\%}, P = 0.088). Conclusions For unilateral vocal fold paresis/paralysis after thyroidectomy, we recommend absorbable mass injection laryngoplasty, voice training, and neurolysis during the first 12 months but laryngeal reinnervation after 12 months. For bilateral vocal fold paresis/paralysis, we recommend early laterofixation and combined laser arytenoidectomy with posterior cordectomy after 12 months.},

abstract = {For treatment of early stage (Tis-T2) laryngeal cancer the main choice is between microlaryngoscopy with carbon dioxide laser resection (laser surgery) and radiotherapy. Because both treatments provide excellent tumour control, secondary outcome variables such, as quality of voice may be of importance in treatment preference. In this study tumour outcomes and quality of voice were analysed for a cohort of patients with early stage (Tis-T2) laryngeal (glottic) carcinoma. The "physical subscale" of the voice handicap index questionnaire (VHI) and a validated five-item screening questionnaire were used. Analysis of 89 patients treated with laser surgery and 159 patients treated with radiotherapy revealed a 5-year local control of 75 and 86 {\%} (p = 0.07). Larynx preservation (5-year) was, however, superior in patients treated with laser surgery, 93 vs 83 {\%} (p {\textless} 0.05). Tumour outcomes were also analysed per tumour stage and none were of significant difference. Quality of voice was analysed in 142 patients. VHI scores were 12.4 ± 8.9 for laser surgery and 8.3 ± 7.7 for radiotherapy (p {\textless} 0.05), with a higher score reflecting a worse outcome. VHI scores per tumour stage for laser surgery and radiotherapy were, respectively, 12.0 ± 9.9 and 7.9 ± 7.5 in T1a (p = 0.06), 16.7 ± 9.0 and 4.9 ± 6.6 in T1b (p {\textless} 0.05). Outcomes of the five-item questionnaire showed voice deficiency in 33 {\%} for laser surgery and 23 {\%} for radiotherapy in T1a (p = 0.330) and 75 and 5 {\%} for T1b (p = 0.001). Oncologic outcomes of laser surgery and radiotherapy were comparable. Larynx preservation is, however, preferable in patients initially treated with laser surgery. According to subjective voice analysis, outcomes were comparable in T1a lesions. Depth of laser resection is of influence on voice deficiency displayed by a significantly higher percentage of voice deficiency in patients treated with laser surgery for T1b lesions.},

abstract = {In order to minimize neurological symptoms and treatment-related side-effects, patients with primary or secondary brain tumors receive dexamethasone. The goal of this study was to analyze dosage and duration of dexamethasone intake and to compare the advantages and disadvantages of this medication during the course of radiation therapy (RT). Data from 138 consecutive patients were therefore analyzed retrospectively. During the course of therapy, the dosage of dexamethasone was evaluated, as were the indications for and duration of this treatment, its side-effects and any clinical changes reported during dexamethasone intake. The dosage of dexamethasone was higher at the outset and during RT (median 7-12 mg/day) than at the end of RT (median 1-6 mg/day). The average duration of dexamethasone intake was 23 weeks for patients with primary, and 7 weeks for patients with secondary brain tumors. The most frequent side-effects were a rise in serum glucose level, peripheral edema, psychiatric disorders, and Cushing's syndrome. Life-threatening complications remained rare. Initially, dexamethasone led to good clinical improvement with few side-effects of RT, whereas by the end of RT the symptom relief was slight and toxicity increased. In a group of 13 patients who received no dexamethasone during RT, 12 showed neither RT-related side-effects nor of neurological impairment. Dexamethasone effectively minimizes neurological symptoms and RT-related side-effects in patients with primary and secondary brain tumors. Nevertheless, the side-effects of dexamethasone itself increase over time. For this reason, a generalized dose scheme should not be used. Instead, dosage should be adapted to each patient's individual needs. Future prospective studies will have to determine whether dexamethasone is advantageous on balance or not.},

abstract = {AIMS: To study the mechanism of action of steroids in patients with peritumorous oedema. METHODS: To investigate early cerebral metabolic changes proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) was used before and 11 to 14 hours after treatment with dexamethasone (12 mg oral loading and 4 mg four times daily maintenance). Nine patients (two men, seven women, mean age 54) with pronounced oedema associated with various intracranial tumours (two astrocytomas, three meningiomas, two glioblastoma, and two metastases) were examined using MRI and MRS. SE1500/135 volume selected MRS (mean volume 21 ml) were performed on an oedematous region and a contralateral region. All spectra were acquired with and without water suppression. Metabolite peak area ratios were determined. RESULTS: Regions of oedema had significantly (P {\textless} 0.01) higher unsuppressed water than the contralateral regions, as expected. There was no change at this early time point after dexamethasone. The ratio of the area of choline containing compounds to that creatine and phosphocreatine compounds was determined after which the serial ratios of these before and after were calculated (a serial ratio of 1.0 would indicate no change in the choline to creatine ratios after steroid administration). The mean serial ratios for the area of oedema were 1.02 (SEM 0.08) and 1.10 (0.08) for the contralateral volume of interest, indicating no significant changes. However, significant changes (P {\textless} 0.02) were found in the N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA)/choline serial ratios (0.86 (0.06) in the area of oedema, 1.20 (0.10) in contralateral brain) and the NAA/creatine serial ratios (0.86 (0.08) for the oedema, 1.25 (0.11) in contralateral brain). CONCLUSIONS: Such rapid changes may be explained either by relatively large alterations in the relaxation characteristics of NAA or, more controversially, by actual changes in the amounts of NAA. It is proposed that steroids act primarily by causing early metabolic changes that are later expressed in improvements in intracranial volume relations.},

However, no studies have compared wait-list mortality risk among end-stage liver disease (ESLD) candidates with high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores to those listed as Status-1A. We aimed to determine if there are MELD scores for ESLD candidates at which their wait-list mortality risk is higher than that of Status-1A, and to identify the factors predicting wait-list mortality among those who are Status-1A. Data were obtained from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients for adult LT candidates (n = 52,459) listed between September 1, 2001, and December 31, 2007. Candidates listed for repeat LT as Status-1 A were excluded. Starting from the date of wait listing, candidates were followed for 14 days or until the earliest occurrence of death, transplant, or granting of an exception MELD score. ESLD candidates were categorized by MELD score, with a separate category for those with calculated MELD {\textgreater} 40. We compared wait-list mortality between each MELD category and Status-1A (reference) using time-dependent Cox regression. ESLD candidates with MELD {\textgreater} 40 had almost twice the wait-list mortality risk of Status-1A candidates, with a covariate-adjusted hazard ratio of HR = 1.96 (P = 0.004). There was no difference in wait-list mortality risk for candidates with MELD 36-40 and Status-1A, whereas candidates with MELD {\textless} 36 had significantly lower mortality risk than Status-1A candidates. MELD score did not significantly predict wait-list mortality among Status-1A candidates (P = 0.18). Among Status-1A candidates with acetaminophen toxicity, MELD was a significant predictor of wait-list mortality (P {\textless} 0.0009). Posttransplant survival was similar for Status-1A and ESLD candidates with MELD {\textgreater} 20 (P = 0.6).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Candidates with MELD {\textgreater} 40 have significantly higher wait-list mortality and similar posttransplant survival as candidates who are Status-1A, and therefore, should be assigned higher priority than Status-1A for allocation. Because ESLD candidates with MELD 36-40 and Status-1A have similar wait-list mortality risk and posttransplant survival, these candidates should be assigned similar rather than sequential priority for deceased donor LT.},

abstract = {In this evidence based case report we addressed the clinical question: which factors predict the occurrence of a pharyngocutaneous fistula after total laryngectomy in patients that already were treated with radiotherapy for a squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx? We searched for relevant synonyms for the domain, being patients earlier treated with radiotherapy for a squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx and having a recurrence for which a salvage total laryngectomy is necessary, with the outcome being the development of a post-operative pharyngocutaneous fistula. We searched for relevant publications in Embase, Pubmed and Web of Science using search terms in title and abstract fields. The search yielded 1764 records, of which three were relevant and valid for our clinical question. Our results show that the absolute risk of a pharyngocutaneous fistula after total laryngectomy in patients earlier treated with radiotherapy for a squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx mainly depends on characteristics and site of the primary tumor. In patients who have a primary glottic laryngeal T1 or T2 tumor the absolute risk of developing a fistula is 11{\%} (95{\%} CI 6; 15{\%}), whereas the risk of developing a fistula in patients with a T3 or T4 extra laryngeal tumor is 35{\%} (95{\%} CI 25; 46{\%}). Other patient and surgical characteristics can however not be ruled out as important prognostic factors since many of them have to date not been studied, e.g. diabetes mellitus, alcohol consumption, smoking, suture materials and surgical technique used.},

abstract = {In making liver transplantation (LT) listing decisions, transplant programs accept that very large differences in expected 5-year posttransplant survival should matter and that small differences in expected survival should not matter. To date, the transplant community has not explicitly addressed the difficult question of how to make decisions when the differences are less dramatic. Existing well-accepted transplant policies neither articulate a criterion for where to draw the line nor provide an ethical justification for distinguishing those who should not be eligible for transplantation from those who should be. Herein we analyze a case from our LT program that raises the issue of how much of a difference should separate the eligible from the ineligible. We explain how our ethical analysis is consistent with the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients cumulative sum metric for transplant center performance, the United Network for Organ Sharing standard of capping Model for End-Stage Liver Disease scores at 40 for listing purposes, and the longstanding tradition of allocating scarce medical resources in accordance with the principle of triage. We also discuss how subjectivity can influence judgments about likely outcomes. We conclude by calling for research to gather data that could make survival predictions objective and by proposing a policy that would make the treatment of all patients fair.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims Patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) are prioritized for liver transplantation (given exception points) due to their high pre- and post-transplantation mortality. However, few studies have evaluated the outcomes of these patients. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study using data submitted to the United Network for Organ Sharing in a study of the effects of room-air oxygenation on pre- and post-transplantation outcomes of patients with HPS. We identified thresholds associated with post-transplantation survival using cubic spline analysis and compared overall survival times of patients with and without HPS. Results From 2002 through 2012, nine hundred and seventy-three patients on the liver transplant waitlist received HPS exception points. There was no association between oxygenation and waitlist mortality among patients with HPS exception points. Transplant recipients with more severe hypoxemia had increased risk of death after liver transplantation. Rates of 3-year unadjusted post-transplantation survival were 84{\%} for patients with PaO2 of 44.1-54.0 mm Hg vs 68{\%} for those with PaO2 {\textgreater}44.0 mm Hg. In multivariable Cox models, transplant recipients with an initial room-air PaO;bsubesub {\textless}44.0 mm Hg had significant increases in post-transplantation mortality (hazard ratio = 1.58; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 1.15-2.18) compared with those with a PaO2 of 44.1-54.0 mm Hg. Overall mortality was significantly lower among waitlist candidates with HPS exception points than those without (hazard ratio = 0.82; 95{\%} CI: 0.70-0.96), possibly because patients with HPS have a reduced risk of pre-transplantation mortality and similar rate of post-transplantation survival. Conclusions Although there was no association between pre-transplantation oxygenation and waitlist survival in patients with HPS Model for End-Stage Liver Disease exception points, a pre-transplantation room-air PaO2 ≤44.0 mm Hg was associated with increased post-transplantation mortality. HPS Model for End-Stage Liver Disease exception patients had lower overall mortality compared with others awaiting liver transplantation, suggesting that the appropriateness of the HPS exception policy should be reassessed.},

The amount of bowing in the resting position and the glottal gap area and vibratory amplitude during phonation were measured from digitized videostroboscopic images. Vibratory amplitude was not decreased on atrophic vocal folds. With the same amount of total bowing, the glottal gap area for bilateral atrophy was smaller than for unilateral atrophy. These results suggest that vocal fold atrophy is not disadvantageous to thyroplasty type I, and that bilateral procedures may produce a better outcome than a unilateral procedure in the treatment of bilateral atrophy. Acoustic, aerodynamic, and perceptual parameters of vocal function were measured, The acoustic high-frequency power ratio and the H-index correlated with the glottal gap area. The mean flow rate correlated with the amount of bowing. The degree of dysphonia was related to the size of the glottal gap and bowing. [References: 12]},

abstract = {Several epidemiological studies have shown a positive association between adult height and cancer incidence. The only study conducted among women on mouth and pharynx cancer risk, however, reported an inverse association. This study aims to investigate the association between height and the risk of head and neck cancer (HNC) within a large international consortium of HNC. We analyzed pooled individual-level data from 24 case-control studies participating in the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology Consortium. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated separately for men and women for associations between height and HNC risk. Educational level, tobacco smoking, and alcohol consumption were included in all regression models. Stratified analyses by HNC subsites were performed. This project included 17,666 cases and 28,198 controls. We found an inverse association between height and HNC (adjusted OR per 10 cm height = 0.91; 95{\%} CI 5 0.86-0.95 for men; adjusted OR = 0.86; 95{\%} CI 5 0.79-0.93 for women). In men, the estimated OR did vary by educational level, smoking status, geographic area, and control source. No differences by subsites were detected. Adult height is inversely associated with HNC risk. As height can be considered a marker of childhood illness and low energy intake, the inverse association is consistent with prior studies showing that HNC occur more frequently among deprived individuals. Further studies designed to elucidate the mechanism of such association would be warranted.},

abstract = {Estimation of functional liver reserve in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is of paramount importance to properly select candidates for surgical resection. Together with the value of bilirubin, the presence/absence of ascites and esophageal varices, and the rate of residual liver volume, which are our current parameters to measure functional liver reserve, we sought to investigate the value of preoperative cholinesterases (CHE) in predicting postoperative outcome after hepatic resection for HCC. We reviewed the records of 279 consecutive patients who underwent hepatic resection for HCC in our Unit between 2001 and 2011. The value of preoperative CHE was analyzed against the occurrence of postoperative events. Receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis was used to identify cut-off values of CHE that predicted adverse outcomes. Univariate and multivariate analyses on clinically relevant variables, which included the MELD score among others, were performed. P {\textless} 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Eighty (29 {\%}) of 279 patients had complications, of which 60 (21.5 {\%}) were liver-related. Major morbidity occurred in 16 (6 {\%}) patients. The 30-day postoperative mortality was 1 {\%}. A value of CHE ≤ 5,900 UI/L had a sensitivity of 73 {\%} and a specificity of 67 {\%} in predicting liver-related postoperative complications (P = 0.001). The multivariate analysis revealed that only blood transfusion, major resections, and a value of CHE ≤ 5,900 UI/L independently predicted the risk of morbidity. The results indicated that CHE contributed important information in predicting postoperative outcome after hepatic resection for HCC. Thus, it should be included in the selection process of candidates to surgery for such disease.},

abstract = {The extension of the surgery and closure type of the pharynx can be the determinants in the pharyngocutaneous fistula development. The objective of the study is to evaluate the incidence of pharingocutaneous salivary fistulae after total laryngectomies comparing manual and mechanical sutures. The study is designed as non-randomized, prospective clinical study. Sixty patients with squamous cell carcinoma were submitted to total laryngectomies. In 30 cases, the linear stapler (75 mm) closure (surgical technique described in details) and in other 30 cases manual suture was used. The cases of mechanical suture were prospective and consecutive and the cases of manual suture were a review series of patients who underwent a manual suture of pharynx, in the same period of time. The statistical analysis between the two groups concluded that both were comparable. Fistulae incidence was 6.7{\%} (2/30) in the group with the mechanical suture and 36.7{\%} (11/30) in the group with manual suture closure, presenting a significant difference (p = 0.0047). The total laryngectomy with mechanical closure is an easy and fast learning technique, allowing watertight closure of the pharynx with a low risk of contamination of the surgical field. It is an assured method, even in previously irradiated patients, since we respect the limits of its indication regarding the extension of primary tumor that must be confirmed by previous suspension laryngectomy performed in the operating room.},

abstract = {Recently the Eurotransplant donor risk index (ET-DRI) was published, a model based on data from the Eurotransplant data- base that can be used for risk indication of liver donors within the Eurotransplant region. Because outcome after liver trans- plantation (LT) depends both on donor and recipient risk factors, a combined donor-recipient model (DRM) would give a more complete picture of the overall risk involved. All liver transplants in adult recipients from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2010 in the Eurotransplant region were included. Risk factors in donors and recipients for failure-free (retransplant free) survival were analyzed in univariate and multivariate analyses. A simplified recipient risk index (sRRI) was constructed using all available recipient factors. A total of 4466 liver transplants were analyzed. Median donor risk index and ET-DRI were 1.78 and 1.91, respectively. The ET-DRI was validated in this new cohort (P {\textless} 0.001; concordance index [c-index], 0.59). After construction of a simplified recipient risk index of significant recipient factors, Cox regression analysis showed that the combination ET-DRI and sRRI into a new DRM gave the highest predictive value (P {\textless} 0.001; c-index, 0.62). The combined model of ET-DRI and sRRI gave a significant prediction of outcome after orthotopic LT in the Eurotransplant region, better than the ET-DRI alone. This DRM has potential in comparing data in the literature and correcting for sickness/physical con- dition of transplant recipients. It is a first step toward benchmarking of graft survival in the Eurotransplant region.},

abstract = {Background: Our previous individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis showed that chemotherapy improved survival in patients curatively treated for non-metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), with a higher benefit with concomitant chemotherapy. However the heterogeneity of the results limited the conclusions and prompted us to confirm the results on a more complete database by adding the randomised trials conducted between 1994 and 2000. Methods: The updated IPD meta-analysis included trials comparing loco-regional treatment to loco-regional treatment + chemotherapy in HNSCC patients and conducted between 1965 and 2000. The log-rank-test, stratified by trial, was used to compare treatments. The hazard ratios of death were calculated. Results: Twenty-four new trials, most of them of concomitant chemotherapy, were included with a total of 87 trials and 16,485 patients. The hazard ratio of death was 0.88 (p {\textless} 0.0001) with an absolute benefit for chemotherapy of 4.5{\%} at 5 years, and a significant interaction (p {\textless} 0.0001) between chemotherapy timing (adjuvant, induction or concomitant) and treatment. Both direct (6 trials) and indirect comparisons showed a more pronounced benefit of the concomitant chemotherapy as compared to induction chemotherapy. For the 50 concomitant trials, the hazard ratio was 0.81 (p {\textless} 0.0001) and the absolute benefit 6.5{\%} at 5 years. There was a decreasing effect of chemotherapy with age (p = 0.003, test for trend). Conclusion: The benefit of concomitant chemotherapy was confirmed and was greater than the benefit of induction chemotherapy. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Objective: To determine the viability of horizontal pharyngeal closure during total laryngectomies, as an alternative to vertical and T-closure methods, by evaluating the rates of pharyngocutaneous fistulas (PCFs) and dysphagia postoperatively. Method: Retrospective analysis of postoperative complications associated with horizontal pharyngeal closure during total laryngectomies at a tertiary institution from 2007 to 2011. Chart reviews were performed on a total of 15 total laryngectomy patients with horizontal pharyngeal closure, evaluating for fistula formation and dysphagia compared to reported rates in the literature. Results: Twenty percent (3/15) of patients developed postoperative PCFs, and 18{\%} (2/11) with dysphagia. Patients that had not been tried on oral feeds due to wound complications or those with recurrent disease were excluded for evaluating dysphagia. Conclusion: A literature search revealed no studies evaluating horizontal pharyngeal closure. Reported ranges of PCFs are 13{\%} to 25{\%}, with dysphagia 17{\%} to 70{\%}. This study shows PCFs and dysphagia rates within these ranges. Thus, horizontal pharyngeal closure appears to be a viable alternative to T and vertical closures.},

abstract = {Demand for liver transplantation continues to exceed donor organ supply. Comparing recipient survival to that of comparable candidates without a transplant can improve understanding of transplant survival benefit. Waiting list and post-transplant mortality was studied among a cohort of 12 996 adult patients placed on the waiting list between 2001 and 2003. Time-dependent Cox regression models were fitted to determine relative mortality rates for candidates and recipients. Overall, deceased donor transplant recipients had a 79{\%} lower mortality risk than candidates (HR = 0.21; p {\textless} 0.001). At Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) 18-20, mortality risk was 38{\%} lower (p {\textless} 0.01) among recipients compared to candidates. Survival benefit increased with increasing MELD score; at the maximum score of 40, recipient mortality risk was 96{\%} lower than that for candidates (p {\textless} 0.001). In contrast, at lower MELD scores, recipient mortality risk during the first post-transplant year was much higher than for candidates (HR = 3.64 at MELD 6-11, HR = 2.35 at MELD 12-14; both p {\textless} 0.001). Liver transplant survival benefit at 1 year is concentrated among patients at higher risk of pre-transplant death. Futile transplants among severely ill patients are not identified under current practice. With 1 year post-transplant follow-up, patients at lower risk of pre-transplant death do not have a demonstrable survival benefit from liver transplant.},

Materials and Methods: Segments 2.5-cm wide x 1-cm long were cut from three fresh, frozen, human cadaveric larynges from an 83-year-old man, a 58-year-old woman, and an unknown cadaver. A vertical fracture was induced and repaired with one of three random y assigned fixation techniques (n = 10 in each fixation group). The repaired cartilage was placed in an Instron Universal Testing Device (Boston, MA) and subjected to a three-point bending test. Load to failure was recorded on an analogue graph. Results: All reconstruction techniques significantly differed from each other, with miniplate fixation providing a stronger repair than wire tube batten (P {\textless} .05), wire tube batten providing a stronger repair than wire alone (P {\textless} .01), and miniplate providing a stronger repair than wire alone (P {\textless} .001). Conclusion: In experimentally induced fractures of the human larynx, miniplate fixation consistently yielded the strongest repair.

abstract = {The perceived advantages of endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke in terms of recanalization, the multimodal and targeted approaches, and perhaps the more permissive rules on devices than on medications for their licensing favored the assumption that endovascular treatment is superior to intravenous thrombolysis for acute treatment of ischemic stroke, and its adoption in more advanced stroke centers. However, this assumption has been questioned by recent clinical trial experience showing that endovascular treatment is not superior to intravenous thrombolysis. The new evidence has changed the perception and the importance of conducting randomized trials in this area. This summary examines the background and outcomes of the latest experience with endovascular techniques in acute stroke treatment based on historical data. The new challenge is how to study the latest generation of devices called stent retrievers, which are faster in recanalizing and easier to use, in selected patients with acute ischemic stroke. In the meantime, the available evidence does not provide support for the use of endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke in clinical practice.},

Steroids have been and will remain the backbone of any anti-edematous therapy because of their striking activity, convenient oral administration and also because of their cost-effectiveness. Their side effects, however, can compromise quality of life, particularly upon continuous administration. Therapeutic alternatives which may replace or - at least - help to reduce the steroid dose are limited. However, with the development of new agents such as corticorelin acetate, there is a hope that steroid-induced side effects can be delayed and reduced. The administration of anti-angiogenic agents with steroid-sparing effects, for example, bevacizumab, is limited due to their costs. Increased knowledge on boswellic acids and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors which are available for clinical application may help to exploit their anti-edema activity more efficiently in the future.},

abstract = {There is great promise that ongoing advances in the delivery of therapeutics to the central nervous system (CNS) combined with rapidly expanding knowledge of brain tumor patho-biology will provide new, more effective therapies. Brain tumors that form from brain cells, as opposed to those that come from other parts of the body, rarely metastasize outside of the CNS. Instead, the tumor cells invade deep into the brain itself, causing disruption in brain circuits, blood vessel and blood flow changes, and tissue swelling. Patients with the most common and deadly form, glioblastoma (GBM) rarely live more than 2 years even with the most aggressive treatments and often with devastating neurological consequences. Current treatments include maximal safe surgical removal or biopsy followed by radiation and chemotherapy to address the residual tumor mass and invading tumor cells. However, delivering effective and sustained treatments to these invading cells without damaging healthy brain tissue is a major challenge and focus of the emerging fields of nanomedicine and viral and cell-based therapies. New treatment strategies, particularly those directed against the invasive component of this devastating CNS disease, are sorely needed. In this review, we (1) discuss the history and evolution of treatments for GBM, (2) define and explore three critical barriers to improving therapeutic delivery to invasive brain tumors, specifically, the neuro-vascular unit as it relates to the blood brain barrier, the extra-cellular space in regard to the brain penetration barrier, and the tumor genetic heterogeneity and instability in association with the treatment efficacy barrier, and (3) identify promising new therapeutic delivery approaches that have the potential to address these barriers and create sustained, meaningful efficacy against GBM.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Liver cirrhosis is a major yet largely preventable and underappreciated cause of global health loss. Variations in cirrhosis mortality at the country level reflect differences in prevalence of risk factors such as alcohol use and hepatitis B and C infection. We estimated annual age-specific mortality from liver cirrhosis in 187 countries between 1980 and 2010. METHODS: We systematically collected vital registration and verbal autopsy data on liver cirrhosis mortality for the period 1980 to 2010. We corrected for misclassification of deaths, which included deaths attributed to improbable or nonfatal causes. We used ensemble models to estimate liver cirrhosis mortality with uncertainty by age, sex, country and year. We used out-of-sample predictive validity to select the optimal model. RESULTS: Global liver cirrhosis deaths increased from around 676,000 (95{\%} uncertainty interval: 452,863 to 1,004,530) in 1980 to over 1 million (1,029,042; 670,216 to 1,554,530) in 2010 (about 2{\%} of the global total). Over the same period, the age-standardized cirrhosis mortality rate decreased by 22{\%}. This was largely driven by decreasing cirrhosis mortality rates in China, the US and countries in Western Europe. In 2010, Egypt, followed by Moldova, had the highest age-standardized cirrhosis mortality rates, 72.7 and 71.2 deaths per 100,000, respectively, while Iceland had the lowest. In Egypt, almost one-fifth (18.1{\%}) of all deaths in males 45- to 54-years old were due to liver cirrhosis. Liver cirrhosis mortality in Mexico is the highest in Latin America. In France and Italy, liver cirrhosis mortality fell by 50{\%} to 60{\%}; conversely, in the United Kingdom, mortality increased by about one-third. Mortality from liver cirrhosis was also comparatively high in Central Asia countries, particularly Mongolia, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, and in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, notably Gabon. CONCLUSIONS: Liver cirrhosis is a significant cause of global health burden, with more than one million deaths in 2010. Our study identifies areas with high and/or rapidly increasing mortality where preventive measures to control and reduce liver cirrhosis risk factors should be urgently strengthened.Please see related commentary: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/12/159/abstract.},

abstract = {Anecdotally, in some persons it has been observed by the Senior Author (K.K.) that asymmetries of the mucosal wave exist when examined videostroboscopically. In the vast majority of these people, no pathology is ever discovered. Mucosal wave asymmetries could cause concern for the otolaryngologist, who may consider them to be a forewarning of subclinical pathology and subject the patient to unnecessary, expensive, and anxiety-provoking investigations or interventions. The purpose of this study was to establish the prevalence of mucosal wave asymmetries in an asymptomatic population lacking laryngeal pathology. Acoustic spectral analysis is also utilized to determine if the presence of subharmonics might be associated. A hospital-based, cross-sectional study design was used. The subjects had no known vocal or medical pathologies, and were nonsmoking. The study group was composed of 30 males aged 35-50 years and 30 women between 22-55 years. Each of the males underwent acoustic spectral analysis; and all subjects completed a medical questionnaire, subjective talkativeness rating, and videostroboscopic laryngeal examination. 10.5{\%} of the subjects (exact 95{\%} CI = 4.0-21.5{\%}) exhibited mucosal wave variations at stroboscopy, characterized as periodic lateral phase asymmetries found consistently in both the modal and upper registers. There was no association with the chosen acoustic spectral parameters, talkativeness scales, or questionnaire-based variables. Mucosal wave asymmetries may be a variance of normal, and are likely to be far more common in the general population than previously believed. The prevalence detected here is expected to be important in the clinical laryngology practice, where these asymmetries may be frequently encountered and influencing management decisions. There has been little normative data published for variations of the mucosal wave specifically for epidemiological purposes. Clinically, in the absence of such data, otolaryngologists may over interpret videostroboscopic findings, leading to unnecessary investigations or interventions.},

In this review, we examine the literature pertaining to machine learning in hepatology and liver transplant medicine. We provide an overview of the strengths and limitations of ML tools and their potential applications to both clinical and molecular data in hepatology. ML has been applied to various types of data in liver disease research, including clinical, demographic, molecular, radiological, and pathological data. We anticipate that use of ML tools to generate predictive algorithms will change the face of clinical practice in hepatology and transplantation. This review will provide readers with the opportunity to learn about the ML tools available and potential applications to questions of interest in hepatology.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND {\&} AIMS The model for end-stage liver disease-sodium (MELD-Na) score was introduced for liver allocation in January 2016. We evaluated the effects of liver allocation, based on MELD-Na score, on waitlist and post-transplant outcomes. METHODS We examined 2 patient groups from the United Network for Organ Sharing registry; the MELD-period group comprised patients who were registered as transplant candidates from June 18, 2013 through January 10, 2016 (n=18,850) and the MELD-Na period group comprised patients who were registered from January 11, 2016 through September 30, 2017 (n=14,512). We compared waitlist and post-transplant outcomes and association with serum sodium concentrations between groups. RESULTS Mortality within 90 days on the liver waitlist decreased (hazard ratio [HR], 0.738; P{\textless}.001) and transplant probability increased significantly in the MELD-Na period (HR, 1.217; P{\textless}.001). Although mild, moderate, and severe hyponatremia (130-134 mmol/L, 125-129 mmol/L, and {\textless}125 mmol/L) were independent risk factors for waitlist mortality in the MELD period (HR, 1.354, 1.762, and 2.656; P{\textless}.001, P{\textless}.001, and P{\textless}.001, respectively), compared to the reference standard (135-145 mmol/L), these adverse outcomes were reduced in the MELD-Na period (HR, 1.092, 1.271 and 1.374; P=.27, P=.018, and P=.037, respectively). The adjusted survival benefit of transplant vs individuals placed on the waitlist in the same score categories was definitive for patients with MELD-Na scores of 21-23 in the MELD-Na era (HR, 0.336; P{\textless}.001) compared to MELD scores of 15-17 in the MELD era (HR, 0.365; P{\textless}.001). CONCLUSIONS The MELD-Na score based liver allocation successfully improved waitlist outcomes and provided significant benefit to hyponatremic patients. Given the discrepancy in transplant survival benefit, the current rules for liver allocation might require revision.},

abstract = {Chaos has been observed in turbulence, chemical reactions, nonlinear circuits, the solar system, biological populations, and seems to be an essential aspect of most physical systems. Chaos may also be central to the interpretation of irregularity in voice disorders. This presentation will summarize the results from a series of our recent studies. These studies have demonstrated the prescence of chaos in computer models of vocal folds, experiments with excised larynges, and human voices. Methods based on nonlinear dynamics can be used to quantify chaos and irregularity in vocal fold vibration. Studies have suggested that disordered voices from laryngeal pathologies such as laryngeal paralysis, vocal polyps, and vocal nodules might exhibit chaotic behaviors. Conventional parameters, such as jitter and shimmer, may be unreliable for analysis of periodic and chaotic voice signals. Nonlinear dynamic methods, however, have differentiated between normal and pathological phonations and can describe the aperiodic or chaotic voice. Chaos theory and nonlinear dynamics can enchance our understanding and therefore our assessment of pathological phonation. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Voice Foundation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The incidence of self-reported dysphagia following a laryngectomy is high (72{\%}). The impact, if any, of a surgical closure technique on swallowing biomechanics and dysphagia severity is not known. To date, there is no recommended standard procedure for pharyngeal reconstruction during laryngectomy surgery. The aim of this study was to determine how laryngectomy surgery alters swallowing biomechanics, pharyngeal peak deglutitive pressure, and hypopharyngeal intrabolus pressures and whether these changes in pressure correlate with specific surgical closure after total laryngectomy or with dysphagia severity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSTUDY DESIGN: Combined videoradiography and manometry was used to measure peak mid-pharyngeal, tongue, and intrabolus pressures; anatomical derangements; postswallow residue; and pharyngeal dimensions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSETTING: Radiology Department, St George Hospital, Sydney, Australia.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUBJECTS: Twenty-four patients following total laryngectomy surgery and age-matched control data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: When compared to controls, peak mid-pharyngeal pressures were significantly reduced in laryngectomy patients (P {\textless} .001). Hypopharyngeal intrabolus pressures were significantly higher in patients when compared to controls (P {\textless} .001). Patients who had undergone mucosa-and-muscle pharyngeal reconstruction had higher peak mid-pharyngeal pressures compared to those who had mucosa-alone closure (P ≤ .04). Combined mucosa-and-muscle closure was also associated with reduced postswallow residue, indicative of a more efficient swallow.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Following laryngectomy surgery, pharyngeal pro-pulsive contractile forces are impaired, and there is increased resistance to bolus flow across the pharyngoesophageal segment. These adverse biomechanical effects can be influenced by surgical techniques, providing surgeons with evidence for optimum pharyngeal closure following a laryngectomy to improve swallowing outcomes.},

In most practical sit- uations, the distribution of observed data is unknown and there may exist a number of atypical measurements and outliers. Hence, use of parametric and semiparametric proce- dures that impose restrictive distributional assumptions on observed longitudinal samples becomes questionable. This, in turn, has led to a substantial demand for statistical pro- cedures that enable us to accurately and reliably analyze longitudinal measurements in factorial experiments with minimal conditions on available data, and robust nonparamet- ric methodology offering such a possibility becomes of particular practical importance. In this article, we introduce a new R package nparLD which provides statisticians and researchers from other disciplines an easy and user-friendly access to the most up-to- date robust rank-based methods for the analysis of longitudinal data in factorial settings. We illustrate the implemented procedures by case studies from dentistry, biology, and medicine.},

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of patients with factors that predispose to the development of pharyngocutaneous fistula (i.e. disease extending to the supraglottic region, base of the tongue or pyriform sinuses, and/or radiochemotherapy). SUBJECTS: Between 2002 and 2008, 85 pharyngolaryngectomies were performed in our clinic. Of these patients, 31 were at increased risk of fistula development, of whom 45 per cent developed fistulas post-operatively. This subgroup of 31 patients was compared with a second subgroup of 22 patients at high risk of fistula development, treated between 2009 and 2011 with pharyngolaryngectomy and with a Montgomery salivary stent placed in advance during closure of the neopharynx. RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed a significant reduction in the rate of fistula development, from 45 to 9 per cent (p {\textless} 0.01), with application of the salivary stent. CONCLUSION: These data confirm the preventive effect of a salivary stent placed during pharyngolaryngectomy, for patients at high risk of fistula development.},

The aim of this prospective case–control study was to assess the safety and feasibility of DHOPE in DCD liver transplantation. Methods: In consecutive DCD liver transplantations, liver grafts were treated with end-ischaemic DHOPE. Outcome was compared with that in a control group of DCD liver transplantations without DHOPE, matched for donor age, donor warm ischaemia time, and recipient Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. All patients were followed for 1 year. Results: Ten transplantations involving liver grafts treated with DHOPE were compared with 20 control procedures. There were no technical problems. All 6-month and 1-year graft and patient survival rates were 100 per cent in the DHOPE group. Six-month graft survival and 1-year graft and patient survival rates in the control group were 80, 67 and 85 per cent respectively. During DHOPE, median (i.q.r.) hepatic adenosine 5 ′ -triphosphate (ATP) content increased 11-fold, from 6 (3–10) to 66 (42–87) {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}»mol per g protein (P = 0⋅005). All DHOPE-preserved livers showed excellent early function. At 1 week after transplantation peak serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin levels were twofold lower in the DHOPE group than in the control group (ALT: median 966 versus 1858 units/l respectively, P = 0⋅006; bilirubin: median 1⋅0 (i.q.r. 0⋅7–1⋅4) versus 2⋅6 (0⋅9–5⋅1) mg/dl, P = 0⋅044). None of the ten DHOPE-preserved livers required retransplantation for non-anastomotic biliary stricture, compared with five of 20 in the control group (P = 0⋅140). Conclusion: This clinical study of end-ischaemic DHOPE in DCD liver transplantation suggests that the technique restores hepatic ATP, reduces reperfusion injury, and is safe and feasible. RCTs with larger numbers of patients are warranted to assess the efficacy in reducing post-transplant biliary complications.},

abstract = {Objectives To determine the number of independent variables that can be included in a linear regression model. Study Design and Setting We used a series of Monte Carlo simulations to examine the impact of the number of subjects per variable (SPV) on the accuracy of estimated regression coefficients and standard errors, on the empirical coverage of estimated confidence intervals, and on the accuracy of the estimated R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} of the fitted model. Results A minimum of approximately two SPV tended to result in estimation of regression coefficients with relative bias of less than 10{\%}. Furthermore, with this minimum number of SPV, the standard errors of the regression coefficients were accurately estimated and estimated confidence intervals had approximately the advertised coverage rates. A much higher number of SPV were necessary to minimize bias in estimating the model R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, although adjusted R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} estimates behaved well. The bias in estimating the model R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} statistic was inversely proportional to the magnitude of the proportion of variation explained by the population regression model. Conclusion Linear regression models require only two SPV for adequate estimation of regression coefficients, standard errors, and confidence intervals.},

abstract = {Factors associated with the risk for mortality once placed on the liver transplant waiting list and how this risk relates to center-specific waiting time and transplant activity have not been adequately evaluated. We performed this study to determine the association between center-specific waiting time and waiting list mortality among liver transplant candidates stratified by medical urgency at the time of registration. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to calculate 2-year mortality risk for a cohort of 16,414 registrants added to the United Network for Organ Sharing liver transplant waiting list between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 1997. After controlling for confounding variables, we calculated the mortality risk for centers, organ procurement organizations (OPOs), and states. The relation between center-specific waiting list mortality risk and median waiting time or transplant activity was determined by linear regression. In multivariate analyses, higher initial medical urgency status (relative risk [RR] = 12.8; P {\textless} .001), increasing age (P {\textless} .001), black ethnicity (RR = 1.29; P {\textless} .001), history of previous transplant (RR = 1.2; P = .009), certain liver diagnoses, and smaller center size (RR = 1.39; P = .008) were associated with significantly increased waiting list mortality. Candidates with blood type A (RR = 0.87; P {\textless} .001) and those with cholestatic cirrhosis as the primary diagnosis (RR = 0.73; P {\textless} 0.001) had a reduced risk for dying. There were significant variations in 2-year waiting list mortality risk among centers, OPOs, and states. However, when stratified by medical urgency status at waiting list entry, center-specific waiting time and transplantation rates accounted for almost none of the center-specific waiting list mortality. Although there are variations in waiting list mortality risk among centers, OPOs, and states, there is very little relation between center-specific waiting list mortality and center-specific median waiting time or center-specific transplantation rates when stratified by medical urgency. Waiting time and center transplant rates should not influence liver allocation policy.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Glucocorticoids (dexamethasone) are thought to reduce peritumoural brain oedema by decreasing the permeability of neoplastic capillaries and/or enhancing the clearance of extracellular water. Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) was used to measure the water diffusion parameters of oedematous and normal brain in a group of patients with intracranial tumours before and after steroid treatment. METHODS: Fifteen patients with intracranial tumours (seven with high-grade glioma, four with metastatic carcinoma and four with meningioma) were examined before and 48-72 h after dexamethasone treatment (16 mg/day). The mean diffusivity ({\textless}D{\textgreater}) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were measured for oedematous brain and apparently normal contralateral white matter before and after steroid therapy. RESULTS: In all three patient groups there was a significant decrease in {\textless}D{\textgreater} of oedematous brain after steroid treatment (p{\textless}0.01). There was no significant change in FA of oedematous brain after treatment in any of the three groups. There was also no significant change in either {\textless}D{\textgreater} or FA of apparently normal contralateral white matter after treatment. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that dexamethasone produces a localised reduction in the magnitude of extracellular water molecule mobility, and hence water content, in peritumoural oedematous brain. Furthermore, the magnitude of these changes is similar for both intra- and extra-axial tumours.},

abstract = {Glucocorticoids ameliorate neurologic symptoms in patients with glioblastoma, but their adverse effects limit long-term use. This study sought to identify factors associated with steroid taper success or failure in the early stages of glioblastoma treatment. We retrospectively reviewed steroid prescribing practices from date of surgery until one month following radiotherapy (RT) completion among 85 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma who were treated on a prospective clinical trial with RT and temozolomide. Sufficient information on steroid dosing was available in 72 patients included in the final analysis. The mean age was 54 years, and 65 {\%} were men. Thirty-nine percent had a gross-total resection. Fifteen patients (21 {\%}) tolerated steroid taper without requiring dose increase during the study. Men and patients with Karnofsky performance scale 90-100 were more likely to have a successful steroid taper. The most common symptom of taper failure was headache, but the reason for steroid increase differed among the different time intervals examined: worsening neurologic deficit in the early post-operative period, headache and non-focal symptoms during RT, and headache and seizure post-RT. Of the 50 patients in whom steroid use during RT was known, 36 (72 {\%}) underwent dose reduction and of those, 21 (58 {\%}) required an increase. The successful early taper of steroids in glioblastoma was associated with male gender and better functional status. Steroids are often tapered during RT, but there is frequent taper failure with this approach. A prospective trial with standardized steroid dosing regimens would be needed to verify these findings.},

METHODOLOGY: A total of 166 patients with complete medical records  who underwent total laryngectomy (TL) due to laryngeal cancer were analysed retrospectively. The mean age of the patients was 57.4 (+ 19.6) years. This study looked at a total of 32 different parameters considered to be effective in the development of pharyngocutaneous fistula after total laryngectomy. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (19.2{\%}) had a pharyngocutaneous fistula. Aged over 61 years (p = 0.003), Diabetes Mellitus (DM) (p = 0.002), alcohol use (p = 0.006), history of preoperative radiotherapy (p = 0.001), preoperative tracheotomy (p = 0.017), postoperative low levels of haemoglobin (Hb) (p = 0.029), low levels of preoperative albumin (p = 0.001), total protein and a low alb/glb (albumin/globulin) ratio (p = 0.001), serum prealbumin levels on the third and seventh postoperative days (p = 0.001), high postoperative CRP levels (p = 0.002), T4 stage (extralaryngeal) and presence of transglottic lesion (p = 0.003), presence of stage IV (p = 0.012) lesion, primary surgery accompanied by bilateral neck dissection (p = 0.047), T-shaped oesophagus suture, postoperative  bleeding (p = 0.07), presence of postoperative fever (p = 0.001), presence of skin defect in the anterior neck (p = 0.001) and presence of postoperative depression (p = 0.001) were found to be statistically significant factors in the  development of PCF. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found many parameters associated with  an increased risk of the development of PCF. According to the multivariate regression analysis, aged over 61 years, DM, preoperative RT, preoperative tracheostomy, postoperative Hb under 10 g/dl, prealbumin under 17 mg/dl on the third postoperative day, and a postoperative fever of 38.3 degrees C and above were found be associated with a higher risk of the development of fistulae more than the other risk factors.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: Liver transplantation for patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) with 3 or more failing organs (ACLF-3) is controversial. We compared liver waitlist mortality or removal according to model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score vs ACLF category. We also studied factors associated with reduced odds of survival for 1 year after liver transplantation in patients with ACLF-3. Methods: We analyzed data from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) from 2005 through 2016. We identified patients who were on the waitlist (100,594) and those who received liver transplants (50,552). Patients with ACLF were identified based on the European Association for the Study of the Liver-chronic liver failure criteria. Outcomes were evaluated with competing risks regression, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox proportional hazards regression. Results: Patients with ACLF-3 were more likely to die or be removed from the waitlist, regardless of MELD-sodium (MELD-Na) score, compared with the other ACLF groups; the proportion was greatest for patients with an ACLF-3 score and MELD-Na score below 25 (43.8{\%} at 28 days). Mechanical ventilation at liver transplantation (hazard ratio [HR] 1.49; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 1.22–1.84), donor risk index above 1.7 (HR 1.22; 95{\%} CI 1.09–1.35), and liver transplantation within 30 days of listing (HR 0.89; 95{\%} CI 0.81–0.98) were independently associated with survival for 1 year after liver transplantation Conclusions: In an analysis of data from the UNOS registry, we found high mortality among patients with ACLF-3 on the liver transplant waitlist, even among those with lower MELD-Na scores. So, certain patients with ACLF-3 have poor outcomes regardless of MELD-Na score. Liver transplantation increases odds of survival for these patients, particularly if performed within 30 days of placement on the waitlist. Mechanical ventilation at liver transplantation and use of marginal organs were associated with increased risk of death.},

abstract = {Background {\&} aims: Donation after circulatory death (DCD) in the UK has tripled in the last decade. However, outcomes following DCD liver transplantation are worse than for donation after brainstem death (DBD) liver transplants. This study examines whether a recipient should accept a “poorer quality” DCD organ or wait longer for a “better” DBD organ. Methods: Data were collected on 5,825 patients who were registered on the elective waiting list for a first adult liver-only transplant and 3,949 patients who received a liver-only transplant in the UK between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2015. Survival following deceased donor liver transplantation performed between 2008 and 2015 was compared by Cox regression modelling to assess the impact on patient survival of accepting a DCD liver compared to deferring for a potential DBD transplant. Results: A total of 953 (23{\%}) of the 3,949 liver transplantations performed utilised DCD donors. Five-year post-transplant survival was worse following DCD than DBD transplantation (69.1{\%} [DCD] vs. 78.3{\%} [DBD]; p {\textless}0.0001: adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.65; 95{\%} CI 1.40–1.94). Of the 5,798 patients registered on the transplant list, 1,325 (23{\%}) died or were removed from the list without receiving a transplant. Patients who received DCD livers had a lower risk-adjusted hazard of death than those who remained on the waiting list for a potential DBD organ (adjusted HR 0.55; 95{\%} CI 0.47–0.65). The greatest survival benefit was in those with the most advanced liver disease (adjusted HR 0.19; 95{\%} CI 0.07–0.50). Conclusions: Although DCD liver transplantation leads to worse transplant outcomes than DBD transplantation, the individual's survival is enhanced by accepting a DCD offer, particularly for patients with more severe liver disease. DCD liver transplantation improves overall survival for UK listed patients and should be encouraged. Lay summary: This study looks at patients who require a liver transplant to save their lives; this liver can be donated by a person who has died either after their heart has stopped (donation after cardiac death [DCD]) or after the brain has been injured and can no longer support life (donation after brainstem death [DBD]). We know that livers donated after brainstem death function better than those after cardiac death, but there are not enough of these livers for everyone, so we wished to help patients decide whether it was better for them to accept an early offer of a DCD liver than waiting longer to receive a “better” liver from a DBD donor. We found that patients were more likely to survive if they accepted the offer of a liver transplant as soon as possible (DCD or DBD), especially if their liver disease was very severe.},

abstract = {In many countries, the allocation of liver grafts is based on the Model of End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score and the use of exception points for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). With this strategy, HCC patients have easier access to transplantation than non-HCC ones. In addition, this system does not allow for a dynamic assessment, which would be required to picture the current use of local tumor treatment. This study was based on the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients and included 5,498 adult candidates of a liver transplantation for HCC and 43,528 for non-HCC diagnoses. A proportional hazard competitive risk model was used. The risk of dropout of HCC patients was independently predicted by MELD score, HCC size, HCC number, and alpha-fetoprotein. When combined in a model with age and diagnosis, these factors allowed for the extrapolation of the risk of dropout. Because this model and MELD did not share compatible scales, a correlation between both models was computed according to the predicted risk of dropout, and drop-out equivalent MELD (deMELD) points were calculated. Conclusion: The proposed model, with the allocation of deMELD, has the potential to allow for a dynamic and combined comparison of opportunities to receive a graft for HCC and non-HCC patients on a common waiting list. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.},

abstract = {Background. In the United States, nearly 30{\%} of liver transplants (LT) are performed for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although overall long-term survival is highest with LT, there are limited data on the incremental survival benefit of LT versus other curative options (resection or ablation) due to shunting of patients towards LT. Methods. We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients aged 50-69 with cirrhosis and HCC in the Veterans Health Administration (population enriched with 3 curative treatments) from 2008 to 2016. The cohort was restricted to patients who received LT, resection, or ablation and a calculated model for end-stage liver disease score {\textless}15 at HCC diagnosis. Results. Among 2129 veterans in the analytic cohort, 658 (26.7{\%}) received LT, 244 (11.5{\%}) underwent resection, and 1317 (61.59{\%}) received ablation. In multivariable models, patients who underwent resection (hazard ratio: 5.42; 95{\%} confidence interval: 4.15-7.08) or ablation (hazard ratio: 5.50; 95{\%} confidence interval: 4.51-6.71) had significantly increased hazards of death. However, in absolute terms, the incremental survival benefit of LT over resection or ablation was small, between 0.02 and 0.03 years at 1 year, 0.32-0.42 years at 3 years, and 1.04-1.24 years at 5 years follow-up. These results were consistent in sensitivity analyses accounting for possible immortal time bias, as well as a cohort restricted to early/intermediate stage HCC. Conclusions. Although LT is associated with significantly increased survival compared to resection and ablation, the absolute incremental survival benefit is small over a 5-year time horizon. Optimal selection of patients for LT is critical for maximizing utilization of a scarce resource.},

abstract = {During 1981-1988 63 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue (27 females and 36 males) were treated with radical surgery and postoperative split-course radiotherapy. The 3-week rest period was compensated with a 10{\%} increase in the total radiation dose to 66 Gy. The local control rate was 76{\%} in stage 1, 71{\%} in stage II, 45{\%} in stage III and 0{\%} in stage IV. Failures were observed in 25 (40{\%}) patients, and 8 patients died of intercurrent diseases. For further analysis the material was stratified in three groups according to the time interval between surgery and postoperative radiotherapy: {\textless} 6 weeks, 6-8 weeks and {\textgreater} 8 weeks. The local control rate in the three strata were 75, 57 and 44{\%}, and the 5-year actuarial survival 61, 46 and 30{\%}, respectively. In the logistic regression analysis and the proportional hazard's regression analysis the histologic grade of the primary tumour and the time interval between surgery and the start of radiotherapy were the most important factors influencing respectively local control and time to recurrence. However, it appeared that the lengthening of the time interval was often caused by factors or events which directly can influence the prognosis, such as surgical complications, infections and poor general condition. When cases with such special causes for lengthening of the interval were excluded, the effect of the time interval nearly completely disappeared. It would seem that a final evaluation of the effect of the time interval requires a prospective randomized trial. The same may well hold true for reliable evaluation of the influence of overall treatment time. ?? 1991.},

The voice handicap index questionnaire (VHI) is regarded as the "gold standard". However, in benign laryngeal pathologies and in functional dysphonia, the shorter voice-related quality of life questionnaire (V-RQOL) proved to be equivalent. This study examines the correlation of both questionnaires in patients who had been treated for small (T1 and T2) laryngeal cancer. It was performed during regular outclinic examinations. In total, 65 patients aged 62.1 ± 10.0 years completed the German versions of the VHI and V-RQOL. Their average VHI total score was 38.9 ± 26.0 points and the average V-RQOL score was 70.1 ± 24.4{\%}. The total scores correlated with |$\rho$| = 0.92 and p {\textless} 0.01. Both questionnaires give quasi identical results, the shorter V-RQOL may be favoured for clinical application.},

We retrospectively analyzed the effects of acyclovir-prednisone treatment in 80 Ramsay Hunt patients. Of 28 patients for whom treatment was begun within 3 days of the onset of facial paralysis, the recovery from paralysis was complete in 21 (75{\%}). By comparison, of 23 patients for whom treatment was begun more than 7 days after onset, recovery from facial paralysis was complete in only 7 (30{\%}). A significant difference in facial nerve recovery was found between these groups. Early administration of acyclovir-prednisone was proved to reduce nerve degeneration by nerve excitability testing. Hearing recovery also tended to be better in patients with early treatment. There was no significant difference in facial nerve outcome between intravenous and oral acyclovir treatment.},

abstract = {A multi-state model is used to model a process where subjects transition from one state to the next. For instance, a standard survival curve can be thought of as a simple multi-state model with two states (alive and dead) and one transition between those two states. A diagram illustrating this process is shown in the top left corner of figure 1. In these types of diagrams, each box is a state and each arrow is a possible transition. The top right diagram depicts a classic competing risk analysis, where all subjects start on the left and each subject can make a single transition to one of 3 terminal states. The bottom left diagram shows a common multi-state situation known as the illness-death model with recovery. Finally, the lower right diagram represents sequential events, such as repeated infections in the CGD study. In that case one subject had 8 events so there are 9 states corresponding to entry into the study (0 infections) and the first, second, . . . , eighth events. As will be shown below, there are often multiple choices for the state and transition diagram, and for some data sets it is revealing to look at a problem from multiple views. In addition to deciding the diagram that best matches the research questions, the two other primary decisions are the choice of time scale for the fits, e.g., time from entry in the study vs. time from entry in the state, and what covariates will be used. 2 Multi-state curves 2.1 Aalen-Johansen estimate As a starting point for the analysis, it is important to compute and plot estimates of p(t), which is a vector containing the probability of being in each of the states at time t. If there is no censoring then p becomes a simple tabulation at time t of all the states. For the general case, we compute this using the Aalen-Johansen estimate via the survfit function. Mathematically the estimate is simple. For each unique time where an event occurs, form the transition matrix T (t) with elements or rates of $\lambda$ ij (t) = the fraction of subjects who transition from state i to j at time t, among those in state i just prior to time t. (T is equal to the identity matrix at any time point without an observed transition.) Then p(t) = p(0)},

JMbayes can fit a wide range of joint models, including among others joint models for continuous and categorical longitudinal responses, and provides several options for modeling the association structure between the two outcomes. In addition, this package can be used to derive dynamic predictions for both outcomes, and offers several tools to validate these predictions in terms of discrimination and calibration.

abstract = {Importance Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Current estimates on the burden of cancer are needed for cancer control planning. Objective To estimate mortality, incidence, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 32 cancers in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015. Evidence Review Cancer mortality was estimated using vital registration system data, cancer registry incidence data (transformed to mortality estimates using separately estimated mortality to incidence [MI] ratios), and verbal autopsy data. Cancer incidence was calculated by dividing mortality estimates through the modeled MI ratios. To calculate cancer prevalence, MI ratios were used to model survival. To calculate YLDs, prevalence estimates were multiplied by disability weights. The YLLs were estimated by multiplying age-specific cancer deaths by the reference life expectancy. DALYs were estimated as the sum of YLDs and YLLs. A sociodemographic index (SDI) was created for each location based on income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility. Countries were categorized by SDI quintiles to summarize results. Findings In 2015, there were 17.5 million cancer cases worldwide and 8.7 million deaths. Between 2005 and 2015, cancer cases increased by 33{\%}, with population aging contributing 16{\%}, population growth 13{\%}, and changes in age-specific rates contributing 4{\%}. For men, the most common cancer globally was prostate cancer (1.6 million cases). Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer was the leading cause of cancer deaths and DALYs in men (1.2 million deaths and 25.9 million DALYs). For women, the most common cancer was breast cancer (2.4 million cases). Breast cancer was also the leading cause of cancer deaths and DALYs for women (523 000 deaths and 15.1 million DALYs). Overall, cancer caused 208.3 million DALYs worldwide in 2015 for both sexes combined. Between 2005 and 2015, age-standardized incidence rates for all cancers combined increased in 174 of 195 countries or territories. Age-standardized death rates (ASDRs) for all cancers combined decreased within that timeframe in 140 of 195 countries or territories. Countries with an increase in the ASDR due to all cancers were largely located on the African continent. Of all cancers, deaths between 2005 and 2015 decreased significantly for Hodgkin lymphoma (-6.1{\%} [95{\%} uncertainty interval (UI), -10.6{\%} to -1.3{\%}]). The number of deaths also decreased for esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, and chronic myeloid leukemia, although these results were not statistically significant. Conclusion and Relevance As part of the epidemiological transition, cancer incidence is expected to increase in the future, further straining limited health care resources. Appropriate allocation of resources for cancer prevention, early diagnosis, and curative and palliative care requires detailed knowledge of the local burden of cancer. The GBD 2015 study results demonstrate that progress is possible in the war against cancer. However, the major findings also highlight an unmet need for cancer prevention efforts, including tobacco control, vaccination, and the promotion of physical activity and a healthy diet.},

abstract = {Background/Aims: Serum sodium predicts prognosis in cirrhosis and may improve the prognostic accuracy of the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, but the available information is limited. The aim of the present study was to assess the prognostic value of serum sodium in the prediction of survival at 3 and 12 months after listing in patients with cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation, and to compare its predictive value with that of the MELD score. Patients and methods: 308 consecutive patients with cirrhosis listed for transplantation during a 5-year period were included in the study. The end-point was survival at 3 and 12 months before transplantation. Variables obtained at the time of listing were analysed for prognostic value using multivariable analysis. Accuracy of prognostic variables was analysed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: The MELD score and serum sodium concentration were the only independent predictors of survival at 3 and 12 months after listing. Low serum sodium was associated with an increased risk of death in all subpopulations of patients with cirrhosis categorised according to the major complication developed before listing. The area under the ROC curves for serum sodium and MELD score was not significantly different both at 3 months (0.83 vs 0.79, respectively) and at 12 months (0.70 vs 0.77, respectively). The addition of serum sodium did not significantly improve the accuracy of the MELD score in the prediction of survival at 3 and 12 months. Conclusion: In patients with cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation, serum sodium and MELD were found to be independent predictors of survival. Larger studies are needed to determine whether the addition of serum sodium to MELD can improve its prognostic accuracy.},

abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the postoperative pitch range acquired in cases of unilateral vocal fold paralysis, as well as factors affecting outcomes. Subjects and Methods: We analyzed 39 cases of unilateral vocal fold paralysis for which surgery was performed between January 2006 and January 2009 and for which pitch ranges and the items listed below were measured preoperatively and 1 year postoperatively. Arytenoid adduction (AA) and type I thyroplasty were performed simultaneously in all cases regardless of preoperative severity. AA was performed by the fenestration approach as previously reported. In this procedure, the cricoarytenoid and cricothyroid joints are not released. Correlations between pitch range acquired postoperatively and the following items were examined: (1) pre- and postoperative maximum phonation time (MPT), (2) pre- and postoperative mean airflow rate (MFR), and (3) preoperative pitch range. Furthermore, patients were surveyed regarding their ability to sing after surgery, and the pitch range cutoff value dividing ability and inability to sing was calculated. Results: Pitch range increased significantly from 3 ?? 4.47 halftones (mean ?? standard deviation) preoperatively to 17.5 ?? 5.80 halftones postoperatively. Preoperative MPT, MFR, and pitch range did not correlate with postoperative pitch range. Postoperatively, only MPT correlated with the width of postoperative pitch range. Twenty-three of 39 subjects (59{\%}) responded that they were able to sing, and the pitch range cutoff value dividing the two groups was 22 halftones. Conclusion: AA and type I thyroplasty significantly expanded postoperative pitch range. There was no correlation between preoperative severity and width of pitch range acquired postoperatively. ?? 2012 The Voice Foundation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To describe liver disease related mortality in the United States during 1999-2016 by age group, sex, race, cause of liver disease, and geographic region. DESIGN Observational cohort study. SETTING Death certificate data from the Vital Statistics Cooperative, and population data from the US Census Bureau compiled by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (1999-2016). PARTICIPANTS US residents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Deaths from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, with trends evaluated using joinpoint regression. RESULTS From 1999 to 2016 in the US annual deaths from cirrhosis increased by 65{\%}, to 34 174, while annual deaths from hepatocellular carcinoma doubled to 11 073. Only one subgroup-Asians and Pacific Islanders-experienced an improvement in mortality from hepatocellular carcinoma: the death rate decreased by 2.7{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval 2.2{\%} to 3.3{\%}, P{\textless}0.001) per year. Annual increases in cirrhosis related mortality were most pronounced for Native Americans (designated as "American Indians" in the census database) (4.0{\%}, 2.2{\%} to 5.7{\%}, P=0.002). The age adjusted death rate due to hepatocellular carcinoma increased annually by 2.1{\%} (1.9{\%} to 2.3{\%}, P{\textless}0.001); deaths due to cirrhosis began increasing in 2009 through 2016 by 3.4{\%} (3.1{\%} to 3.8{\%}, P{\textless}0.001). During 2009-16 people aged 25-34 years experienced the highest average annual increase in cirrhosis related mortality (10.5{\%}, 8.9{\%} to 12.2{\%}, P{\textless}0.001), driven entirely by alcohol related liver disease. During this period, mortality due to peritonitis and sepsis in the setting of cirrhosis increased substantially, with respective annual increases of 6.1{\%} (3.9{\%} to 8.2{\%}) and 7.1{\%} (6.1{\%} to 8.4{\%}). Only one state, Maryland, showed improvements in mortality (-1.2{\%}, -1.7{\%} to -0.7{\%} per year), while many, concentrated in the south and west, observed disproportionate annual increases: Kentucky 6.8{\%} (5.1{\%} to 8.5{\%}), New Mexico 6.0{\%} (4.1{\%} to 7.9{\%}), Arkansas 5.7{\%} (3.9{\%} to 7.6{\%}), Indiana 5.0{\%} (3.8{\%} to 6.1{\%}), and Alabama 5.0{\%} (3.2{\%} to 6.8{\%}). No state showed improvements in hepatocellular carcinoma related mortality, while Arizona (5.1{\%}, 3.7{\%} to 6.5{\%}) and Kansas (4.3{\%}, 2.8{\%} to 5.8{\%}) experienced the most severe annual increases. CONCLUSIONS Mortality due to cirrhosis has been increasing in the US since 2009. Driven by deaths due to alcoholic cirrhosis, people aged 25-34 have experienced the greatest relative increase in mortality. White Americans, Native Americans, and Hispanic Americans experienced the greatest increase in deaths from cirrhosis. Mortality due to cirrhosis is improving in Maryland but worst in Kentucky, New Mexico, and Arkansas. The rapid increase in death rates among young people due to alcohol highlight new challenges for optimal care of patients with preventable liver disease.},

abstract = {We sought to characterize sex-based differences in access to deceased donor liver transplantation. Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data were used to analyze n = 78 998 adult candidates listed before (8/1997-2/2002) or after (2/2002-2/2007) implementation of Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD)-based liver allocation. The primary outcome was deceased donor liver transplantation. Cox regression was used to estimate covariate-adjusted differences in transplant rates by sex. Females represented 38{\%} of listed patients in the pre-MELD era and 35{\%} in the MELD era. Females had significantly lower covariate-adjusted transplant rates in the pre-MELD era (by 9{\%}; p {\textless} 0.0001) and in the MELD era (by 14{\%}; p {\textless} 0.0001). In the MELD era, the disparity in transplant rate for females increased as waiting list mortality risk increased, particularly for MELD scores ≤yen;15. Substantial geographic variation in sex-based differences in transplant rates was observed. Some areas of the United States had more than a 30{\%} lower covariate-adjusted transplant rate for females compared to males in the MELD era. In conclusion, the disparity in liver transplant rates between females and males has increased in the MELD era. It is especially troubling that the disparity is magnified among patients with high MELD scores and in certain regions of the United States. {\textcopyright} 2011 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons.},

abstract = {Since 2002, the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) has been used to rank liver transplant candidates. However, despite numerous revisions, MELD allocation still does not allow for equitable access to all waitlisted candidates. An optimized prediction of mortality (OPOM) was developed (http://www.opom.online) utilizing machine-learning optimal classification tree models trained to predict a candidate's 3-month waitlist mortality or removal utilizing the Standard Transplant Analysis and Research (STAR) dataset. The Liver Simulated Allocation Model (LSAM) was then used to compare OPOM to MELD-based allocation. Out-of-sample area under the curve (AUC) was also calculated for candidate groups of increasing disease severity. OPOM allocation, when compared to MELD, reduced mortality on average by 417.96 (406.8-428.4) deaths every year in LSAM analysis. Improved survival was noted across all candidate demographics, diagnoses, and geographic regions. OPOM delivered a substantially higher AUC across all disease severity groups. OPOM more accurately and objectively prioritizes candidates for liver transplantation based on disease severity, allowing for more equitable allocation of livers with a resultant significant number of additional lives saved every year. These data demonstrate the potential of machine learning technology to help guide clinical practice, and potentially guide national policy.},

The purpose is to allow relevant comparisons with the literature when presenting/publishing the results of voice treatment, e.g. a phonosurgical technique, or a new/improved instrument or procedure for investigating the pathological voice. Meta-analyses of the results of voice treatments are generally limited and may even be impossible owing to the major diversity in the ways functional outcomes are assessed. A multidimensional set of minimal basic measurements suitable for all "common" dysphonias is proposed. It includes five different approaches: perception (grade, roughness, breathiness), videostroboscopy (closure, regularity, mucosal wave and symmetry), acoustics (jitter, shimmer, Fo-range and softest intensity), aerodynamics (phonation quotient), and subjective rating by the patient. The protocol is elaborated on the basis of an exhaustive review of the literature, of the experience of the Committee members, and of plenary discussions within the European Laryngological Society. Instrumentation is kept to a minimum, but it is considered essential for professionals performing phonosurgery.},

Thirty patients with T4a laryngeal carcinoma and none of them receiving primary radiotherapy previously were divided into two equal groups. Group A patients had SCM flap augmentation of the pharyngeal closure after total laryngectomy. Group B patients had the standard pharyngeal closure without augmentation. Both groups were followed up for 30 days postoperatively for the development of PCF. The use of the SCM added about extra 15 min to the surgical procedure in all patients (p {\textless} 0.001). The shape of the suture line of the neopharynx was horizontal in 14 patients (7 in each group) while it was T-shaped in the remaining 16 (8 in each group). Neck dissection was done in all patients except only two patients who previously had the neck dissection done in combination with partial laryngectomy. Three patients in each group developed PCF either early (10 days or less postoperatively) or late (more than 10 days but less than 30 days postoperatively). There was no statistically significant difference in the length of hospital stay between the two groups. The use of SCM flap did not reduce the incidence of PCF after total laryngectomy.},

abstract = {Transplant-related malignancies are a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in the organ-recipient population, and most often develop de novo in the immunosuppressed recipient or as recurrent malignancy after transplantation. The least common scenario, and a rare event, is a recipient malignancy derived from the donor organ. Melanoma is one of the most often reported and lethal donor-derived malignancies with a high transmission rate. Donor transmission of melanoma might be related to the biology of melanoma, with regard to tumour dormancy, late recurrence, circulating tumour cells, and the destiny of some micrometastases. Melanoma-cell dormancy explains the late recurrence that can occur after the initial treatment of melanoma, and may be relevant to our understanding and management of some melanoma micrometastasis in the sentinel node. The high incidence of circulating tumour cells in early melanoma should be considered in the context of the transmission of melanoma by apparent disease-free organ donors following removal of a primary melanoma up to 32 years before. This scenario suggests that melanoma cells can remain dormant at distant sites for decades (and possibly forever) in immunocompetent patients, only to reactivate after transplantation into an immunosuppressed recipient. Potential organ donors should be carefully screened for a history of melanoma, and excluded. The current recommendation for treatment of donor-related melanoma includes withdrawal of immunosuppression, graft rejection, and explantation of the allograft after rejection has been established. In non-renal transplant patients with life-sustaining organs, withdrawal of immunosuppression and graft rejection is not feasible, and reduction of immunosuppression or urgent retransplantation are the only possible salvage strategies. The transmission of malignancy by organ donation could be considered " nature's own experiment" , but raises questions that our current understanding of the biology of melanoma cannot answer. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Ten patients (20{\%}) demonstrated a sinus tract originating from the pharyngeal suture line. A clinical salivary fistula developed in all four patients with a sinus tract 2 cm or longer, but in only one of six patients with a tract shorter than 2 cm. Other factors predictive of salivary fistula included tumor stage, previous radiation therapy, and the presence of concurrent postoperative complications.

abstract = {Advances in molecular biology and immunology have renewed interest in the development of vaccines for the treatment or prevention of cancer. Research over the past 10 years has focused on the identification of suitable tumour antigens to use as targets for a variety of vaccine strategies. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was one of the first tumour antigens described, and is commonly expressed by a wide range of adenocarcinomas. Recent studies have identified several human-leukocyte-antigen-restricted epitopes (short peptides) within the CEA protein that can be recognised by human T lymphocytes (T cells). Although CEA-expressing tumour cells are generally weakly recognised by the immune system, several new strategies have been used to enhance immune responses against CEA. This includes using antibodies directed against CEA; inserting the CEA gene into recombinant viruses and bacteria as viral and bacterial vaccines; pulsing the CEA protein, peptides, DNA or RNA onto dendritic cells (specialised antigen-presenting cells); and combining CEA vaccines with cytokines or co-stimulatory molecules to increase vaccine effectiveness. Other factors that might be important in establishing systemic immunity against CEA are the dose, route, timing, and choice of vector and adjuvants for vaccine administration. Further research in understanding the fundamental processes involved in tumour-cell recognition by the immune system, better animal models, and improved clinical trial designs will help to define the full potential of CEA as a target for cancer vaccine development.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To report on the results of using a lateral thyrotomy approach on the paraglottic space to gain greater access for laryngocele resection under direct vision. STUDY DESIGN A 26-year prospective and retrospective study. The study was conducted on 10 adult patients (5 men and 5 women) who had laryngocele of varying size on the paraglottic space. Six of the patients had internal laryngocele and four had exteriorized laryngocele. Five laryngoceles were left-sided, three were right-sided, and two were bilateral. METHODS A V-shaped, full-thickness thyroid lamina resection with the triangle base at the superior border and the apex at a point midway of the thyroid lamina vertical extent was performed. RESULTS A V-shaped lateral thyrotomy made exposure to the paraglottic space possible for direct submucosal laryngocele dissection. This approach has presented no complications to date. Postoperative minor edema or hematoma was found in the aryepiglottic and ventricular folds, but this disappeared within a few days. There was no recurrence; the minimum follow-up was 1 year. CONCLUSION The triangular lateral thyrotomy approach provided access to the paraglottic space and superb visibility for resection of laryngocele of any size under direct vision, thus avoiding recurrence, morbidity, and complications.},

abstract = {Background: Prognostic models often show poor performance when applied to independent validation data sets. We illustrate how treatment use in a validation set can affect measures of model performance and present the uses and limitations of available analytical methods to account for this using simulated data. Methods: We outline how the use of risk-lowering treatments in a validation set can lead to an apparent overestimation of risk by a prognostic model that was developed in a treatment-na{\"{i}}ve cohort to make predictions of risk without treatment. Potential methods to correct for the effects of treatment use when testing or validating a prognostic model are discussed from a theoretical perspective. Subsequently, we assess, in simulated data sets, the impact of excluding treated individuals and the use of inverse probability weighting (IPW) on the estimated model discrimination (c-index) and calibration (observed:expected ratio and calibration plots) in scenarios with different patterns and effects of treatment use. Results: Ignoring the use of effective treatments in a validation data set leads to poorer model discrimination and calibration than would be observed in the untreated target population for the model. Excluding treated individuals provided correct estimates of model performance only when treatment was randomly allocated, although this reduced the precision of the estimates. IPW followed by exclusion of the treated individuals provided correct estimates of model performance in data sets where treatment use was either random or moderately associated with an individual's risk when the assumptions of IPW were met, but yielded incorrect estimates in the presence of non-positivity or an unobserved confounder. Conclusions: When validating a prognostic model developed to make predictions of risk without treatment, treatment use in the validation set can bias estimates of the performance of the model in future targeted individuals, and should not be ignored. When treatment use is random, treated individuals can be excluded from the analysis. When treatment use is non-random, IPW followed by the exclusion of treated individuals is recommended, however, this method is sensitive to violations of its assumptions.},

However, the specific contributions of the respiratory and phonatory components of the speech-production mechanism to this task are not typically assessed. Six women and 6 men with normal speech and voice were monitored for lung volume during a standard MPD task, and for laryngeal airway resistance (R(law)) during a modified MPD (slow syllable-repetition) task. On average, subjects used 90{\%} of their vital capacity (VC) for their best MPD trial. There was no systematic relation between MPD and VC for these subjects. R(law) was strongly correlated with MPD for the men (r(s) = 0.886 for /a/; r(s) = 0.829 for /i/), but not for the women. R(law) increased linearly as lung volume decreased (slope {\textgreater} 0.15) for a subset of trials (32{\%}). This was a common pattern for four of the subjects. The clinical utility of MPD to assess breathing for speech is questioned because of the lack of association between MPD and VC, and some atypical laryngeal-valving strategies.},

abstract = {The joint modelling of longitudinal and survival data is a highly active area of biostatistical research. The submodel for the longitudinal biomarker usually takes the form of a linear mixed effects model. We describe a flexible parametric approach for the survival submodel that models the log baseline cumulative hazard using restricted cubic splines. This approach overcomes limitations of standard parametric choices for the survival submodel, which can lack the flexibility to effectively capture the shape of the underlying hazard function. Numerical integration techniques, such as Gauss-Hermite quadrature, are usually required to evaluate both the cumulative hazard and the overall joint likelihood; however, by using a flexible parametric model, the cumulative hazard has an analytically tractable form, providing considerable computational benefits. We conduct an extensive simulation study to assess the proposed model, comparing it with a B-spline formulation, illustrating insensitivity of parameter estimates to the baseline cumulative hazard function specification. Furthermore, we compare non-adaptive and fully adaptive quadrature, showing the superiority of adaptive quadrature in evaluating the joint likelihood. We also describe a useful technique to simulate survival times from complex baseline hazard functions and illustrate the methods using an example data set investigating the association between longitudinal prothrombin index and survival of patients with liver cirrhosis, showing greater flexibility and improved stability with fewer parameters under the proposed model compared with the B-spline approach.

abstract = {The performance of prediction models can be assessed using a variety of methods and metrics. Traditional measures for binary and survival outcomes include the Brier score to indicate overall model performance, the concordance (or c) statistic for discriminative ability (or area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve), and goodness-of-fit statistics for calibration.Several new measures have recently been proposed that can be seen as refinements of discrimination measures, including variants of the c statistic for survival, reclassification tables, net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Moreover, decision-analytic measures have been proposed, including decision curves to plot the net benefit achieved by making decisions based on model predictions.We aimed to define the role of these relatively novel approaches in the evaluation of the performance of prediction models. For illustration, we present a case study of predicting the presence of residual tumor versus benign tissue in patients with testicular cancer (n = 544 for model development, n = 273 for external validation).We suggest that reporting discrimination and calibration will always be important for a prediction model. Decision-analytic measures should be reported if the predictive model is to be used for clinical decisions. Other measures of performance may be warranted in specific applications, such as reclassification metrics to gain insight into the value of adding a novel predictor to an established model. {\textcopyright} 2009 by Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to find a correlation between closure technique in pharyngeal closure and outcomes of both pharyngocutaneous fistula and post-laryngectomy stricture after laryngectomy. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective Chart Review. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a total of 151 patients over a 20-year period from January 1994 to December of 2013 who underwent primary pharyngeal reconstruction after total laryngectomy specifically looking at the closure technique in relation to pharyngo-cutaneous fistula (PCF) and post-laryngectomy stricture postoperatively. Patients were excluded based on secondary pharyngeal closure. Using logistic regression modelling, we performed univariate and multivariate analyses of our data. RESULTS: The overall PCF and post-laryngectomy stricture rates were 19.1{\%} and 15.8{\%}. When salvage laryngectomy was excluded, t-type closure had a significantly lower risk of fistula rate (P=.038) compared to vertical closure. In multivariate analysis, this statistical significance was lost (P=.23); however, non-salvage t-type closure remained significantly better than both salvage laryngectomy groups (t-type, P=.033, vertical, P=.037), while non-salvage vertical closure had no significant difference from other groups. There was no difference in stricture rate between the two closure techniques (P=.63). CONCLUSION: Our study supports the role of t-type closure decreasing fistula rates in primary pharyngeal reconstruction. Orientation of the pharyngeal closure does not appear to change the risk of post-laryngectomy stricture formation after total laryngectomy. Salvage laryngectomy with primary pharyngeal reconstruction remains an independent risk factor for fistula formation.},

abstract = {In 1999, the Institute of Medicine suggested that instituting a continuous disease severity score that de-emphasizes waiting time could improve the allocation of cadaveric livers for transplantation. This report describes the development and initial implementation of this new plan. The goal was to develop a continuous disease severity scale that uses objective, readily available variables to predict mortality risk in patients with end-stage liver disease and reduce the emphasis on waiting time. Mechanisms were also developed for inclusion of good transplant candidates who do not have high risk of death but for whom transplantation may be urgent. The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) and Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease (PELD) scores were selected as the basis for the new allocation policy because of their high degree of accuracy for predicting death in patients having a variety of liver disease etiologies and across a broad spectrum of liver disease severity. Except for the most urgent patients, all patients will be ranked continuously under the new policy by their MELD/PELD score. Waiting time is used only to prioritize patients with identical MELD/PELD scores. Patients who are not well served by the MELD/PELD scores can be prioritized through a regionalized peer review system.

abstract = {Purpose: To compare the validity,reliability and responsiveness of a single,global quality of life question to multi-item scales. Method: Data were obtained from 83 consecutive pts with esophageal adenocarcinoma undergoing either transhiatal or transthoracic esophagectomy.Qulaity of Life was measured at baseline, 5 wks, 3 and 12 mth post-op with a single-item Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 100, the multi-item Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-20 (MOS SF-20) and Rotterdam Symptom Check-List (RSCL).Convergent and discriminant validity,test-retest reliability and both distribution-based and anchor-based responsiveness were evaluated. Major findings: At baseline and at 5 wks, the VAS showed high correlations with the MOS SF-20 health perceptions scale (r=0.70 and 0.72) and moderate to high correlations with all other subscales of the MOS SF-20 and RSCL (r=0.29-0.70). The test-retest reliability intra-class correlation for the VAS was 0.87. At 5 wks post-op, the distribution-based responsiveness was moderate for the VAS (standardised response mean: -0.47; effect size:-0.56), high for the physical subscales of the MOS SF-20 and RSCL (-1.08 to -1.51) and low for the psychological subscales (0.11 to -0.25). Five wks post-op, anchor-based responsiveness was highest fot the VAS (r=0.54). Conclusion: The VAS is an instrument with good validity, excellent reliability, moderate distribution-based responsiveness and good anchor-based responsiveness compared to multi-item questionnaires.Its use is recommended in clinical trials to assess global quality of life.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: Patients with cirrhosis hospitalized for an acute decompensation (AD) and organ failure are at risk for imminent death and considered to have acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). However, there are no established diagnostic criteria for ACLF, so little is known about its development and progression. We aimed to identify diagnostic criteria of ACLF and describe the development of this syndrome in European patients with AD. Methods: We collected data from 1343 hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and AD from February to September 2011 at 29 liver units in 8 European countries. We used the organ failure and mortality data to define ACLF grades, assess mortality, and identify differences between ACLF and AD. We established diagnostic criteria for ACLF based on analyses of patients with organ failure (defined by the chronic liver failure-sequential organ failure assessment [CLIF-SOFA] score) and high 28-day mortality rate ({\textgreater}15{\%}). Results: Of the patients assessed, 303 had ACLF when the study began, 112 developed ACLF, and 928 did not have ACLF. The 28-day mortality rate among patients who had ACLF when the study began was 33.9{\%}, among those who developed ACLF was 29.7{\%}, and among those who did not have ACLF was 1.9{\%}. Patients with ACLF were younger and more frequently alcoholic, had more associated bacterial infections, and had higher numbers of leukocytes and higher plasma levels of C-reactive protein than patients without ACLF (P {\textless}.001). Higher CLIF-SOFA scores and leukocyte counts were independent predictors of mortality in patients with ACLF. In patients without a prior history of AD, ACLF was unexpectedly characterized by higher numbers of organ failures, leukocyte count, and mortality compared with ACLF in patients with a prior history of AD. Conclusions: We analyzed data from patients with cirrhosis and AD to establish diagnostic criteria for ACLF and showed that it is distinct from AD, based not only on the presence of organ failure(s) and high mortality rate but also on age, precipitating events, and systemic inflammation. ACLF mortality is associated with loss of organ function and high leukocyte counts. ACLF is especially severe in patients with no prior history of AD. {\textcopyright} 2013 AGA Institute.},

abstract = {Hyponatremia is associated with elevated wait-list mortality among end-stage liver disease candidates for liver transplanta- tion (LT). However, the effect of low serum sodium on the survival benefit of LT has not been examined. We sought to deter- mine whether pretransplant hyponatremia is associated with an altered LT survival benefit. Data were obtained from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. The study population consisted of adults (age!18 years) placed on the waiting list for LT between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2012 (n569,213). The effect of hyponatremia on the survival benefit was assessed via sequential stratification, an extension of Cox regression. Each transplant recipient was matched to appro- priate candidates then active on the waiting list with the same Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score and in the same donation service area. The focus of the analysis was the interaction between the serum sodium and the MELD score with respect to the survival benefit of LT; this was defined as the covariate-adjusted hazard ratio contrasting post-LT mortal- ity and pre-LT mortality. The LT survival benefit increased significantly with decreasing serum sodium values when the MELD scores were {\textgreater}11. The survival benefit of LT was not affected by serum sodium for patients with MELD scores 11. In conclusion, the LT survival benefit (or lack thereof) is independent of serum sodium for patients with MELD scores 11. The increase in the survival benefit with decreasing serum sodium among patients with MELD scores{\textgreater}11 is consistent with recently approved changes to the allocation system incorporating serum sodium.},

Significant morbidity can be associated with severe cases. Objectives: This review addresses the effect of antiviral therapy on Bell's palsy. Search strategy: We updated the search of the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register (December 2008), MEDLINE (from January 1966 to December 8 2008), EMBASE (from January 1980 to December 8 2008) and LILACS (from January 1982 to December 2008). Selection criteria: Randomized trials of antivirals with and without corticosteroids versus control therapies for the treatment of Bell's palsy. Data collection and analysis: Twenty-three papers were selected for consideration. Main result:s Seven trials including 1987 participants met the inclusion criteria, adding five studies to the two in the previous review. Incomplete recovery at one year: There was no significant benefit in the rate of incomplete recovery from antivirals compared with placebo (n = 1886, RR 0.88, 95{\%} CI 0.65 to 1.18). Inmeta-analyses with some unexplained heterogeneity, the outcome with antivirals was significantly worse than with corticosteroids (n = 768, RR 2.82, 95{\%} CI 1.09 to 7.32) and the outcome with antivirals plus corticosteroids was significantly better than with placebo (n = 658, RR 0.56, 95{\%} CI 0.41 to 0.76).

We examined the incidence of subsequent post-LT end-stage renal disease (ESRD) before and after the policy was implemented. Data on all adult deceased donor LT recipients between April 27, 1995 and December 31, 2008 (n = 59 242), from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients,were linkedwith Centers for Medicare {\&} Medicaid Services' ESRD data. Cox regression was used to (i) compare pre-MELD and MELD eras with respect to post-LT ESRD incidence, (ii) determine the risk factors for post-LT ESRD and (iii) quantify the association between ESRD incidence and mortality. Crude rates of post-LT ESRD were 12.8 and 14.5 per 1000 patient-years in the pre-MELD andMELD eras, respectively. Covariate-adjusted post-LT ESRD risk was higher in the MELD era (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.15; p = 0.0049). African American race, hepatitis C, pre- LT diabetes, higher creatinine, lower albumin, lower bilirubin and sodium{\textgreater}141 mmol/L at LTwere also significant predictors of post-LT ESRD. Post-LT ESRD was associated with higher post-LT mortality (HR = 3.32; p {\textless} 0.0001). The risk of post-LT ESRD, a strong predictor of post-LT mortality, is 15{\%} higher in the MELD era. This study identified potentially modifiable risk factors of post-LT ESRD. Early intervention and modification of these risk factors may reduce the burden of post-LT ESRD. {\textcopyright} Copyright 2011 The American Society of Transplantation.},

abstract = {Although jitter, shimmer, and noise acoustically characterize all voice signals, their perceptual importance in naturally produced pathological voices has not been established psychoacoustically. To determine the role of these attributes in the perception of vocal quality, listeners were asked to adjust levels of jitter, shimmer, and the noise-to-signal ratio in a speech synthesizer, so that synthetic voices matched naturally produced tokens. Results showed that, although listeners agreed well in their judgments of the noise-to-signal ratio, they did not agree with one another in their chosen settings for jitter and shimmer. Noise-dependent differences in listeners' ability to detect changes in amounts of jitter and shimmer implicate both listener insensitivity and inability to isolate jitter and shimmer as separate dimensions in the overall pattern of aperiodicity in a voice as causes of this poor agreement. These results suggest that jitter and shimmer are not useful as independent indices of perceived vocal quality, apart from their acoustic contributions to the overall pattern of spectrally shaped noise in a voice.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe this institution's experience with and the long-term outcomes of early type 1 thyroplasty for unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) following surgery on the aortic arch. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review with telephone questionnaire. SETTING: Academic tertiary care center. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Three hundred forty-eight patients with UVFP following surgery on the aortic arch since 1999 were identified; 40 were available for follow-up. The number of revision procedures following initial thyroplasty was ascertained, and the Voice Handicap Index (VHI) was administered by telephone. The hypothesis that early thyroplasty produced voice outcomes and revision rates comparable to injection laryngoplasty was established prior to the initiation of data collection. RESULTS: Six out of the 40 patients (15{\%}) required revision thyroplasty following their initial procedure. Mean VHI of all patients was 36.0 (SD, 27.2). Mean VHI was significantly different in the 18 to 39 age group (13.1) when compared to the 40 to 59 (51.8) and 60+ (37.7) age groups (P = .013). Mean follow-up since initial thyroplasty was 46.5 months (SD, 42.2). CONCLUSIONS: In the setting of aortic arch surgery with injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, early thyroplasty produces voice outcomes comparable to those achieved in the literature with repeated injection and delayed thyroplasty and can be considered in select populations.},

abstract = {Liver transplantation (LT) is curative for most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, 10{\%}-15{\%} of patients experience HCC recurrence. Patients who are reported as within Milan criteria by imaging are frequently found to be outside the criteria on explant. This under-staging of HCC worsens post-LT outcomes. However, risk factors for under-staging have not been elucidated. Furthermore, it is not known if there is regional or center-level variation in under-staging. We conducted a retrospective analysis of adult patients transplanted for HCC in the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database between 2012 and 2016. Under-staging was determined on the basis of comparing pre-LT imaging to explant findings. Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox regression were used to evaluate the impact of under-staging on HCC recurrence and post-LT survival. Mixed effects logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for under-staging and to study regional and center-level variation in adjusted analyses. A total of 5424 patients were included in the cohort, of whom 24.9{\%} (n = 1353) were under-staged. Post-LT HCC recurrence and death were significantly associated with under-staging (each P {\textless} 0.001). In adjusted analyses, independent predictors of under-staging included age (odds ratio [OR], 1.13 per 10 years; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.25), male sex (OR, 1.61; 95{\%} CI, 1.36-1.89), down-staging (OR, 4.03; 95{\%} CI, 2.65-6.11), and pre-LT alpha-fetoprotein (P {\textless} 0.001). There was also significant variation in under-staging between UNOS regions and among transplant centers, ranging from 14.8{\%} to 38.1{\%}. We report novel risk factors for HCC under-staging, which worsens post-LT outcomes. Significant center-level and regional variation in under-staging highlights the need for standards that achieve greater uniformity in staging.},

Understanding risk factors and successful treatment strategies may improve treatment outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: Historical cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary care medical center. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Patients at a tertiary care center who underwent a total laryngectomy between 2003 and 2009 (N = 263) were evaluated in a retrospective manner. Patient demographics, comorbidities, tobacco and alcohol usage, dietary outcomes, feeding tube dependence, and treatment modalities were assessed. Management strategies and outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: Strictures developed in 19{\%} (n = 49) of patients, and the majority (82{\%}) occurred in the first year. Incidences of stricture formation were similar for primary (19{\%}) and salvage laryngectomy (19{\%}) patients. Patients undergoing salvage laryngectomy were 2 times more likely to be reconstructed with a free flap, whereas those undergoing a primary laryngectomy were 3 times more likely to be closed primarily. Tubed flap reconstruction significantly increased the incidence of stricture formation compared to primary closure (P = .02) in salvage laryngectomy cases. In primary laryngectomy patients, stricture formation did not correlate with flap reconstruction (P = .34) or adjuvant radiation therapy (P = .79). Patients who required a single dilation had better dietary outcomes compared to patients who required serial dilations (P = .14). There was no difference in overall disease-free survival in primary vs salvage laryngectomy patients (P = .95).

There were no statistically significant differences between the fistula group and the non-fistula group with regard to pre-operative tracheotomy, tumour differentiation, positive surgical margins, concurrent neck dissection, previous radiotherapy, T stage of the tumour, presence of extended hypopharyngeal mucosal excision, and placement of nasogastric tube. The only statistically significant positive association was found with primary pharyngeal myotomy. Myotomy was performed in six of the fistula patients and in two cases a technical error was observed. In these cases myotomy was performed adjacent to the edge of hypopharyngeal mucosa resulting in a weakened area of pharyngeal closure, possibly contributing to the fistula. This should be kept in mind and avoided at all costs during the performance of myotomy. Since it was not possible to find out any specific causal relationship with myotomy in four other cases, further studies are needed to establish the association of myotomy with pharyngocutaneous fistula.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: Liver transplant candidates with mild hepatic synthetic dysfunction and marked renal insufficiency may have higher Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores than candidates with severe liver disease and normal renal function. We re-estimated MELD coefficients and evaluated the effect of updated MELD on the liver transplant waiting list ranking. Methods: Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data was analyzed for 38,899 adults wait-listed between September, 2001 and December, 2006. A time-dependent Cox regression waiting list mortality model estimated updated MELD component coefficients. Rank correlation between existing and updated MELD scores was computed. Results: Existing MELD component coefficient (loge creatinine, 0.957 vs 1.266 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 1.21-1.32]; loge bilirubin, 0.378 vs 0.939 [95{\%} CI, 0.91-0.97]; loge international normalized ratio, 1.120 vs 1.658 [95{\%} CI, 1.58-1.74]) was significantly different than updated counterpart. Index of concordance was higher for updated MELD than existing MELD for predicting overall (0.68 vs. 0.64) and 90-day waiting list mortality (0.77 vs. 0.75). Rank correlation between existing and updated MELD scores was 0.95 for all candidates and 0.72 for candidates with existing MELD ≥20. Among candidates with equal existing MELD, those with lower creatinine and higher bilirubin had significantly higher waiting list mortality. Conclusions: Existing MELD coefficient components are significantly different than those calculated from national waiting list data. Updated MELD assigns lower weight to creatinine and international normalized ratio and higher weight to bilirubin. Updated MELD better predicts waiting list mortality. Using updated MELD for liver allocation would alter waiting list candidate ranking. {\textcopyright} 2008 AGA Institute.},

abstract = {A 3-year prospective study on primary tracheoesophageal puncture was carried out at Nanavati Hospital and Tata Memorial Hospital, Bombay, to assess its feasibility in a developing country and its success in vocal rehabilitation. We report our experience with primary tracheoesophageal puncture in 64 patients (57 males and 7 females) following surgical treatment for carcinoma of the pyriform fossa (45 cases) and endolarynx (19 cases). All patients underwent total laryngectomies with or without partial pharyngectomy and primary pharyngeal mucosal closure. Fifty-one patients underwent primary surgery followed by postoperative radiotherapy. At 3 months successful tracheoesophageal speech was achieved in 84{\%} patients, although this percentage decreased to 67{\%} at 9 months. There were no major complications. Successful vocal rehabilitation was related more to "patient factors" such as delays in seeking medical attention when prosthetic valves dislodged, improper use and care of the valves and inability to learn speech with the prosthesis. Overall, primary tracheoesophageal puncture was found to be feasible and should be used more extensively for vocal rehabilitation following laryngectomy in developing countries.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: A consensus has been reached that liver donor allocation should be based primarily on liver disease severity and that waiting time should not be a major determining factor. Our aim was to assess the capability of the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score to correctly rank potential liver recipients according to their severity of liver disease and mortality risk on the OPTN liver waiting list. Methods: The MELD model predicts liver disease severity based on serum creatinine, serum total bilirubin, and INR and has been shown to be useful in predicting mortality in patients with compensated and decompensated cirrhosis. In this study, we prospectively applied the MELD score to estimate 3-month mortality to 3437 adult liver transplant candidates with chronic liver disease who were added to the OPTN waiting list at 2A or 2B status between November, 1999, and December, 2001. Results: In this study cohort with chronic liver disease, 412 (12{\%}) died during the 3-month follow-up period. Waiting list mortality increased directly in proportion to the listing MELD score. Patients having a MELD score {\textless}9 experienced a 1.9{\%} mortality, whereas patients having a MELD score ≥40 had a mortality rate of 71.3{\%}. Using the c-statistic with 3-month mortality as the end point, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the MELD score was 0.83 compared with 0.76 for the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score (P {\textless} 0.001). Conclusions: These data suggest that the MELD score is able to accurately predict 3-month mortality among patients with chronic liver disease on the liver waiting list and can be applied for allocation of donor livers.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the gold-standard nonsurgical organ-preservation treatment for advanced laryngeal carcinoma. Total laryngectomy (TL) is increasingly reserved for surgical salvage. Salvage surgery is associated with more complications than primary surgery. A systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken to establish the impact of organ preservation protocols on pharyngo-cutaneous fistula incidence following TL, and to synthesize evidence on the role of "onlay" prophylactic tissue flaps in reducing this complication in salvage TL.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDATA SOURCES: The English language literature (January 1, 2000, to September 1, 2013) was searched, using PUBMED and EMBASE databases, for the terms "laryngectomy" and "fistula." Of 522 studies identified from database searches, 33 were included in the quantitative synthesis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nREVIEW METHODS: Studies reporting fistula incidence following primary TL (PTL), salvage TL (STL), and STL with "onlay" flap-reinforced pharyngeal closure were included. Data were extracted by the first author (M.S.). Meta-analysis of fistula incidence was performed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: PTL fistula incidence is 14.3{\%} (95{\%} CI 11.7-17.0), STL 27.6{\%} (23.4-31.8), and STL with flap-reinforced closure 10.3{\%} (4.6-15.9). Chemoradiotherapy is associated with a pooled fistula incidence of 34.1{\%} (22.6-45.6), compared to 22.8{\%} (18.3-27.4) for radiotherapy alone. Relative risk of fistula is 0.566 (0.374-0.856, P = 0.001) for STL with flap-reinforced closure compared to STL alone. The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one fistula is 6.05.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Prophylactic flaps used in an "onlay" technique reduce fistula incidence in STL. Chemoradiotherapy increases fistula incidence more than radiotherapy alone. Prophylactic flaps should be offered in salvage cases after failed chemoradiation protocols.},

abstract = {The role of intraoperative porto-caval shunts in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is controversial. Aim of this study was to analyze the effects of an intraoperative, porto-caval catheter-shunt on graft function and survival following cava sparing OLT. Four hundred and forty-eight piggy back liver transplantations with or without a temporary spontaneous porto-caval shunt between 1997 and 2010 were analyzed (shunt n = 274 vs. no shunt n = 174). Lab MELD scores and donor risk indices (DRI) were calculated. Hepatic injury (ALT, AST), -function (bilirubin, prothrombin ratio), postreperfusion liver blood flow and graft survival were registered [mean follow-up: 50.5 (0-163.0) months]. The impact of a shunt on graft survival was determined using multivariate analysis. Usage of a porto-caval shunt was associated with reduced hepatic injury (ALT, AST), whereas graft function was not affected. The shunt group showed a significantly increased portal venous blood flow after reperfusion. Retransplantation rate was decreased (7.7{\%} vs. 20.1{\%}, P = 0.001) and long-term graft survival was significantly increased with a porto-caval shunt (hazard ratio 2.1, P {\textless} 0.001). This effect was even more pronounced for marginal organs. Usage of intraoperative porto-caval catheter-shunts is beneficial in cava sparing OLT and is associated with reduced ischemia-reperfusion injury and improved organ survival in particular for recipients of marginal organs.},

Dysphagia may result from many factors, including the type of laryngectomy surgery employed and the use of adjuvant treatments (e.g. radiotherapy and chemotherapy). Dysphagia may also be compounded by other co-morbid factors, such as ageing and depression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAIM: To investigate the methods of surgical closure used by Australian ENT and head and neck surgeons after undertaking total laryngectomy surgery.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: In order to audit surgical variation, 56 short questionnaires were sent to all Australian ENT and head and neck surgeons who were registered members of the Australia and New Zealand Head and Neck Society.

In fact, serum concentrations and BChE activity seem to accurately reflect the availability of amino acidic substrates and/or derangement in protein synthesis due to hepatocellular damage. In cancer, with or without liver impairment, serum BChE levels serve as an accurate functional and prognostic indicator, useful for monitoring clinical and therapeutic interventions according to patients' prognosis. In the absence of inflammation, BChE could also serve as an index of the effectiveness of nutritional support.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Serum BChE assessment should be included in routine clinical diagnostic procedures to evaluate patient clinical conditions, in particular in cases of inflammation and/or protein-energy malnutrition.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Liver cancer is among the leading causes of cancer deaths globally. The most common causes for liver cancer include hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and alcohol use. OBJECTIVE: To report results of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2015 study on primary liver cancer incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 195 countries or territories from 1990 to 2015, and present global, regional, and national estimates on the burden of liver cancer attributable to HBV, HCV, alcohol, and an "other" group that encompasses residual causes. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: Mortality was estimated using vital registration and cancer registry data in an ensemble modeling approach. Single-cause mortality estimates were adjusted for all-cause mortality. Incidence was derived from mortality estimates and the mortality-to-incidence ratio. Through a systematic literature review, data on the proportions of liver cancer due to HBV, HCV, alcohol, and other causes were identified. Years of life lost were calculated by multiplying each death by a standard life expectancy. Prevalence was estimated using mortality-to-incidence ratio as surrogate for survival. Total prevalence was divided into 4 sequelae that were multiplied by disability weights to derive years lived with disability (YLDs). DALYs were the sum of years of life lost and YLDs. MAIN OUTCOMESAND MEASURES: Liver cancer mortality, incidence, YLDs, years of life lost, DALYs by etiology, age, sex, country, and year. RESULTS: There were 854 000 incident cases of liver cancer and 810 000 deaths globally in 2015, contributing to 20 578 000 DALYs. Cases of incident liver cancer increased by 75{\%} between 1990 and 2015, of which 47{\%} can be explained by changing population age structures, 35{\%} by population growth, and -8{\%} to changing age-specific incidence rates. The male-to-female ratio for age-standardized liver cancer mortality was 2.8. Globally, HBV accounted for 265 000 liver cancer deaths (33{\%}), alcohol for 245 000 (30{\%}), HCV for 167 000 (21{\%}), and other causes for 133 000 (16{\%}) deaths, with substantial variation between countries in the underlying etiologies. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Liver cancer is among the leading causes of cancer deaths in many countries. Causes of liver cancer differ widely among populations. Our results show that most cases of liver cancer can be prevented through vaccination, antiviral treatment, safe blood transfusion and injection practices, as well as interventions to reduce excessive alcohol use. In line with the Sustainable Development Goals, the identification and elimination of risk factors for liver cancer will be required to achieve a sustained reduction in liver cancer burden. The GBD study can be used to guide these prevention efforts.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: Liver allocation for hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is undergoing constant re-evaluation in the United States, but the impact of geographic differences in organ access has not been examined. Methods: From February 28th, 2002 until November 20th, 2009, 9730 adult patients with T2 HCC and 326 Beyond Milan HCC patients were studied using the UNOS database. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated and log-rank tests were used to test for differences in survival curves. Results: Length of waiting time and presence/absence of loco-regional therapy in T2 HCC patients did not significantly impact transplant recipient (p = 0.65) and graft survival (p = 0.74) (Fig. 1B). Regions with median waiting times {\textgreater}6 months performed more loco-regional therapy (Fig. 1D) and had significantly higher waiting list dropout rates (Regions 1: p = 0.01; 5: p {\textless}0.001, and 9: p {\textless}0.001). T2 HCC post-transplant outcomes were not significantly different between UNOS regions (Fig. 2) or between T2 and Beyond Milan HCC patients (transplant recipient p = 0.37, and graft p = 0.72 survival) (Fig. 1C). The Beyond Milan cohort had significantly greater dropout/death (p = 0.007) and a worse overall survival trend (p = 0.11) (Fig. 1C). Conclusions: Analysis of the UNOS database shows inhomogeneous access to liver transplantation in the United States. Regions with longer waiting times had significantly higher T2 HCC dropout rates (Table 2), and used more loco-regional therapy (Fig. 1D). Conversely, T2 HCC patients had uniform liver transplant outcomes despite geographic differences (Fig. 2). Beyond Milan HCC patients showed significantly greater dropout/death (p = 0.007) and a worse overall survival trend in an intent-to-treat analysis (p = 0.11) (Fig. 1C). {\textcopyright} 2011 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

abstract = {Several studies in recent years have already reported good oncologic results with laser microsurgery in the treatment of early glottic carcinoma. We conducted a longitudinal voice evaluation, in patients with early glottic cancer who underwent transoral laser cordectomy, in order to assess the voice quality outcome and its relationship with objective and subjective (voice handicap index questionnaire and GIRBAS scale) means. Twenty-four previously untreated patients underwent transoral laser cordectomy for early glottic cancer. All patients underwent subjective and objective voice assessment according to the multidimensional voice protocol recommended by the European Laryngological Society including acoustic, perceptual and stroboscopic analysis combined to patient self assessment of voice (voice handicap index-VHI). These evaluations were performed before treatment and 6 months after the treatment. Vocal fold healing was complete in all cases by 6 months following surgery. Main voice parameters (subjective and objective) resulted improved at the 6-month control after surgery. In particular, voice handicap index (VHI) and GIRBAS scale resulted reliable for voice assessment and for the postoperative follow-up. In conclusion, VHI, GIRBAS, multidimensional voice program (MDVP) and spectroacoustic parameters showed a close trend in the present study, and this confirms the validity of the voice analysis performed by each tool.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND : Recent evidence has suggested that intra-arterial thrombolysis may provide benefit beyond intravenous thrombolysis in ischemic stroke patients. Previous meta-analyses have only compared intra-arterial thrombolysis with standard treatment without thrombolysis. The objective was to review the benefits and harms of intra-arterial thrombolysis in ischemic stroke patients. METHODS : We undertook a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy and safety of intra-arterial thrombolysis with either standard treatment or intravenous thrombolysis following acute ischemic stroke. Primary outcomes included poor functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale 3-6), mortality, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Study quality was assessed, and outcomes were stratified by comparison treatment received. RESULTS : Four trials (n = 351) comparing intra-arterial thrombolysis with standard treatment were identified. Intra-arterial thrombolysis reduced the risk of poor functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale 3-6) [relative risk (RR) = 0{\textperiodcentered}80; 95{\%} confidence interval = 0{\textperiodcentered}67-0{\textperiodcentered}95; P = 0{\textperiodcentered}01]. Mortality was not increased (RR = 0{\textperiodcentered}82; 95{\%} confidence interval = 0{\textperiodcentered}56-1{\textperiodcentered}21; P = 0{\textperiodcentered}32); however, risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was nearly four times more likely (RR = 3{\textperiodcentered}90; 95{\%} confidence interval = 1{\textperiodcentered}41-10{\textperiodcentered}76; P = 0{\textperiodcentered}006). Two trials (n = 81) comparing intra-arterial thrombolysis with intravenous thrombolysis were identified. Intra-arterial thrombolysis was not found to reduce poor functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale 3-6) (RR = 0{\textperiodcentered}68; 95{\%} confidence interval = 0{\textperiodcentered}46-1{\textperiodcentered}00; P = 0{\textperiodcentered}05). Mortality was not increased (RR = 1{\textperiodcentered}12; 95{\%} confidence interval = 0{\textperiodcentered}47-2{\textperiodcentered}68; P = 0{\textperiodcentered}79); neither was symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (RR = 1{\textperiodcentered}13; 95{\%} confidence interval = 0{\textperiodcentered}32-3{\textperiodcentered}99; P = 0{\textperiodcentered}85). Differences in time from symptom onset-to-treatment and type of thrombolytic administered were found across the trials. CONCLUSIONS : This analysis finds a modest benefit of intra-arterial thrombolysis over standard treatment, although it does not find a clear benefit of intra-arterial thrombolysis over intravenous thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke patients. However, few trials, small sample sizes, and indirectness limit the strength of evidence.},

abstract = {"Preface Joint models for longitudinal and time-to-event data have become a valuable tool in the analysis of follow-up data. These models are applicable mainly in two settings: First, when focus is in the survival outcome and we wish to account for the effect of an endogenous time-dependent covariate measured with error, and second, when focus is in the longitudinal outcome and we wish to correct for nonrandom dropout. Due to their capability to provide valid inferences in settings where simpler statistical tools fail to do so, and their wide range of applications, the last 25 years have seen many advances in the joint modeling field. Even though interest and developments in joint models have been widespread, information about them has been equally scattered in articles, presenting recent advances in the field, and in book chapters in a few texts dedicated either to longitudinal or survival data analysis. However, no single monograph or text dedicated to this type of models seems to be available. The purpose in writing this book, therefore, is to provide an overview of the theory and application of joint models for longitudinal and survival data. In the literature two main frameworks have been proposed, namely the random effects joint model that uses latent variables to capture the associations between the two outcomes (Tsiatis and Davidian, 2004), and the marginal structural joint models based on G estimators (Robins et al., 1999, 2000). In this book we focus in the former. Both subfields of joint modeling, i.e., handling of endogenous time-varying covariates and nonrandom dropout, are equally covered and presented in real datasets"-- Preface -- 1. Introduction -- 1.1.

abstract = {Objective: The pharyngocutaneous fistula (PCF) is the troublesome complication after total laryngectomy. Despite a large number of investigations having been performed, there is still controversy about which factors are most significant for PCF. The objective of the present meta-analysis was to analyze the potential risk factors for PCF after total laryngectomy. Data sources: Published English-language literature. Review methods: PubMed, Ovid, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched using multiple search terms. Twenty-one studies with 3832 patients were identified. The quality of evidence was assessed by The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Results: Sixteen studies involving 2598 patients were included for the meta-analysis. The results showed that, tumor subsite (RR. =. 0.64, 95{\%} CI 0.47-0.88, P{\textless}. 0.01), T stage (RR. =. 0.70, 95{\%} CI 0.51-0.96, P=. 0.03), previous radiotherapy (RR. =. 0.62, 95{\%} CI 0.46-0.84, P{\textless}. 0.01), postoperative hemoglobin {\textless}12.5. g/L (RR. =. 0.46, 95{\%} CI 0.27-0.76, P{\textless}. 0.01), and surgical margin (RR. =. 0.41, 95{\%} CI 0.22-0.74, P{\textless}. 0.01) were the risk factors associated with the development of PCF. Conclusions: From the results of our study, several significant risk factors for PCF are identified. Methodologically high-quality comparative studies are needed for further evaluation.},

abstract = {Background In 2010, overweight and obesity were estimated to cause 3{\textperiodcentered}4 million deaths, 3{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} of years of life lost, and 3{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) worldwide. The rise in obesity has led to widespread calls for regular monitoring of changes in overweight and obesity prevalence in all populations. Comparable, up-to-date information about levels and trends is essential to quantify population health effects and to prompt decision makers to prioritise action. We estimate the global, regional, and national prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adults during 1980-2013. Methods We systematically identified surveys, reports, and published studies (n=1769) that included data for height and weight, both through physical measurements and self-reports. We used mixed effects linear regression to correct for bias in self-reports. We obtained data for prevalence of obesity and overweight by age, sex, country, and year (n=19 244) with a spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression model to estimate prevalence with 95{\%} uncertainty intervals (UIs). Findings Worldwide, the proportion of adults with a body-mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m2 or greater increased between 1980 and 2013 from 28{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (95{\%} UI 28{\textperiodcentered}4-29{\textperiodcentered}3) to 36{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} (36{\textperiodcentered}3-37{\textperiodcentered}4) in men, and from 29{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (29{\textperiodcentered}3- 30{\textperiodcentered}2) to 38{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} (37{\textperiodcentered}5-38{\textperiodcentered}5) in women. Prevalence has increased substantially in children and adolescents in developed countries; 23{\textperiodcentered}8{\%} (22{\textperiodcentered}9-24{\textperiodcentered}7) of boys and 22{\textperiodcentered}6{\%} (21{\textperiodcentered}7-23{\textperiodcentered}6) of girls were overweight or obese in 2013. The prevalence of overweight and obesity has also increased in children and adolescents in developing countries, from 8{\textperiodcentered}1{\%} (7{\textperiodcentered}7-8{\textperiodcentered}6) to 12{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} (12{\textperiodcentered}3-13{\textperiodcentered}5) in 2013 for boys and from 8{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (8{\textperiodcentered}1-8{\textperiodcentered}8) to 13{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} (13{\textperiodcentered}0-13{\textperiodcentered}9) in girls. In adults, estimated prevalence of obesity exceeded 50{\%} in men in Tonga and in women in Kuwait, Kiribati, Federated States of Micronesia, Libya, Qatar, Tonga, and Samoa. Since 2006, the increase in adult obesity in developed countries has slowed down. Interpretation Because of the established health risks and substantial increases in prevalence, obesity has become a major global health challenge. Not only is obesity increasing, but no national success stories have been reported in the past 33 years. Urgent global action and leadership is needed to help countries to more effectively intervene.

abstract = {Context: Transplantation using kidneys from deceased donors who meet the expanded criteria donor (ECD) definition (age ≥60 years or 50 to 59 years with at least 2 of the following: history of hypertension, serum creatinine level {\textgreater}1.5 mg/dL [132.6 $\mu$mol/L], and cerebrovascular cause of death) is associated with 70{\%} higher risk of graft failure compared with non-ECD transplants. However, if ECD transplants offer improved overall patient survival, inferior graft outcome may represent an acceptable trade-off. Objective: To compare mortality after ECD kidney transplantation vs that in a combined standard-therapy group of non-ECD recipients and those still receiving dialysis. Design, Setting, and Patients: Retrospective cohort study using data from a US national registry of mortality and graft outcomes among kidney transplant candidates and recipients. The cohort included 109 127 patients receiving dialysis and added to the kidney waiting list between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2002, and followed up through July 31, 2004. Main Outcome Measure: Long-term (3-year) relative risk of mortality for ECD kidney recipients vs those receiving standard therapy, estimated using time-dependent Cox regression models. Results: By end of follow-up, 7790 ECD kidney transplants were performed. Because of excess ECD recipient mortality in the perioperative period, cumulative survival did not equal that of standard-therapy patients until 3.5 years posttransplantation. Long-term relative mortality risk was 17{\%} lower for ECD recipients (relative risk, 0.83; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.77-0.90; P{\textless}.001). Subgroups with significant ECD survival benefit included patients older than 40 years, both sexes, non-Hispanics, all races, unsensitized patients, and those with diabetes or hypertension. In organ procurement organizations (OPOs) with long median waiting times ({\textgreater}1350 days), ECD recipients had a 27{\%} lower risk of death (relative risk, 0.73; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.64-0.83; P{\textless}.001). In areas with shorter waiting times, only recipients with diabetes demonstrated an ECD survival benefit. Conclusions: ECD kidney transplants should be offered principally to candidates older than 40 years in OPOs with long waiting times. In OPOs with shorter waiting times, in which non-ECD kidney transplant availability is higher, candidates should be counseled that ECD survival benefit is observed only for patients with diabetes. {\textcopyright}2005 American Medical Association.

abstract = {BACKGROUND {\&} AIMS: There have been many studies on plasma butyrylcholinesterase in liver dysfunction. However, no data is available about acetylcholinesterase in human cirrhosis, although profound changes have been described in cirrhotic rat models.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Human serum and liver acetylcholinesterase and its molecular forms were determined enzymatically, after butyrylcholinesterase immunodepletion. The distinct species of acetylcholinesterase, with a distinct C-terminus, were determined by western blotting, and the level of liver transcripts by real-time PCR. Liver acetylcholinesterase was also evaluated by immunocytochemistry.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In patients with liver cirrhosis, the activity of plasma acetylcholinesterase (rich in light species), appeared to be apparently unaffected. However, the levels of the soluble readthrough (R) acetylcholinesterase form, an acetylcholinesterase species usually associated with stress and pathology, was increased compared to controls. Human liver acetylcholinesterase activity levels were also unchanged, but protein levels of the acetylcholinesterase-R and other acetylcholinesterase subunit species were increased in the cirrhotic liver. This increase in acetylcholinesterase protein expression in the cirrhotic liver was confirmed by PCR analysis. Immunohistological examination confirmed that acetylcholinesterase immunoreactivity is increased in parenchymal cells of the cirrhotic liver.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate significant changes in acetylcholinesterase at the protein and mRNA levels in liver cirrhosis, with no difference in enzymatic activity. The altered expression of acetylcholinesterase protein may reflect changes in its pathophysiological role.},

abstract = {Traditional interval or ordinal rating scale protocols appear to be poorly suited to measuring vocal quality. To investigate why this might be so, listeners were asked to classify pathological voices as having or not having different voice qualities. It was reasoned that this simple task would allow listeners to focus on the kind of quality a voice had, rather than how much of a quality it possessed, and thus might provide evidence for the validity of traditional vocal qualities. In experiment 1, listeners judged whether natural pathological voice samples were or were not primarily breathy and rough. Listener agreement in both tasks was above chance, but listeners agreed poorly that individual voices belonged in particular perceptual classes. To determine whether these results reflect listeners' difficulty agreeing about single perceptual attributes of complex stimuli, listeners in experiment 2 classified natural pathological voices and synthetic stimuli (varying in f0 only) as low pitched or not low pitched. If disagreements derive from difficulties dividing an auditory continuum consistently, then patterns of agreement should be similar for both kinds of stimuli. In fact, listener agreement was significantly better for the synthetic stimuli than for the natural voices. Difficulty isolating single perceptual dimensions of complex stimuli thus appears to be one reason why traditional unidimensional rating protocols are unsuited to measuring pathologic voice quality. Listeners did agree that a few aphonic voices were breathy, and that a few voices with prominent vocal fry and/or interharmonics were rough. These few cases of agreement may have occurred because the acoustic characteristics of the voices in question corresponded to the limiting case of the quality being judged. Values of f0 that generated listener agreement in experiment 2 were more extreme for natural than for synthetic stimuli, consistent with this interpretation.},

abstract = {Hyponatremia is a frequent complication of advanced cirrhosis related to an impairment in the renal capacity to eliminate solute-free water that causes a retention of water that is disproportionate to the retention of sodium, thus causing a reduction in serum sodium concentration and hypo-osmolality. The main pathogenic factor responsible for hyponatremia is a nonosmotic hypersecretion of arginine vasopressin (or antidiuretic hormone) from the neurohypophysis related to circulatory dysfunction. Hyponatremia in cirrhosis is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. There is evidence suggesting that hyponatremia may affect brain function and predispose to hepatic encephalopathy. Hyponatremia also represents a risk factor for liver transplantation as it is associated with increased frequency of complications and impaired short-term survival after transplantation. The current standard of care based on fluid restriction is unsatisfactory. Currently, a new family of drugs, known as vaptans, which act by antagonizing specifically the effects of arginine vasopressin on the V2 receptors located in the kidney tubules, is being evaluated for their role in the management of hyponatremia. The short-term treatment with vaptans is associated with a marked increase in renal solute-free water excretion and improvement of hyponatremia. Long-term administration of vaptans seems to be effective in maintaining the improvement of serum sodium concentration, but the available information is still limited. Treatment with vaptans represents a novel approach to improving serum sodium concentration in cirrhosis.},

We do not know if they are of any benefit to the patient or the health-care funder. To determine the benefits and harms of different interventions in decreasing the infectious complications and improving the outcomes after liver resection. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded until August 2011. We included all randomised clinical trials that were performed to compare interventions aimed at decreasing the infectious complications after liver resection. Two authors independently identified the trials and extracted the data. We analysed the data with both the fixed-effect and the random-effects model using RevMan Analysis. For each outcome we calculated the risk ratio (RR), rate ratio, or mean difference (MD) with 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) based on available patient data analysis. We included seven trials including 521 patients for this review. The sample size in the trials varied from 12 to 180 patients. All the trials were of high risks of systematic errors and of random errors. Four trials included patients who underwent liver resection only. In the remaining three trials, patients underwent combined liver resection with extrahepatic biliary resection resulting in a biliary enteric anastomosis. Four trials included only major liver resection. The remaining three trials included a mixture of major and minor liver resections. It appears that the proportion of cirrhotic patients in the trials was very low. The comparisons performed included whether antibiotics are necessary routinely during the peri-operative period of liver resection, the duration of antibiotics, the use of prebiotics and probiotics in the perioperative period, use of recombinant bactericidal-permeability increasing protein 21 (rBPI21), and the use of topical povidone iodine gel at the time of wound closure. Only one or two trials were included under each comparison. There was no significant differences in mortality or severe morbidity in any of the comparisons. Quality of life was not reported in any of the trials. There is currently no evidence to support or refute the use of any treatment to reduce infectious complications after liver resections. Further well designed trials with low risk of systematic error and low risk of random errors are necessary.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: A total laryngectomy (TL) is performed as a primary or salvage therapy for laryngeal carcinoma. Pharyngotomy closure after TL is typically performed using manual sutures. Automatic stapling devices are routinely used in thoracoabdominal surgery, but have not been widely accepted for use in pharyngotomy closure. Previously described closed stapling techniques of pharyngeal closure do not allow direct evaluation of surgical margins and are limited to endolaryngeal disease. We describe an open technique for pharyngotomy closure using a mechanical stapling device. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review. METHODS: A review was conducted of 16 total laryngectomies performed from May 2008 to August 2015 utilizing an Ethicon Endopath ETS Compact-Flex 45 stapler. RESULTS: Sixteen patients (15 male, one female), mean age 69 years, received open TL (14 salvage, two primary) with endostapler pharyngeal closure and primary tracheoesophageal puncture (TEP). Surgical time averaged 218 minutes. Median time to swallowing was 4 days (range, 2-240 days) and mean hospital stay 6 days (range, 3-10 days). Fistula incidence was 31{\%} (5/16) overall and 36{\%} (5/14) in the postradiation patients. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical stapling is a simple method for postlaryngectomy open pharyngotomy closure. This technique allows evaluation of margins, easy primary TEP, and the opportunity for early swallowing and shorter hospital stays. In addition, it can be performed for closure of salvage laryngectomies with rates of fistula formation similar to that found in the literature using suture closure techniques. Future studies are necessary to compare oncological results and surgical complications between the open and closed stapling techniques and to traditional suture closure.

Acting as guides pairing with ribosomal (rRNA) and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), snoRNAs direct partner enzymes to specific sites for uridine isomerization or ribose methylation, thereby influencing stability, folding and protein-interacting properties of target RNAs. In recent years, however, numerous non-canonical functions have also been ascribed to certain members of the snoRNA group, ranging from regulation of mRNA editing and/or alternative splicing to posttranscriptional gene silencing by a yet poorly understood pathway that may involve microRNA-like mechanisms. While some of these intriguing snoRNAs (the so-called orphan snoRNAs) have no sequence complementarity to rRNA or snRNA, others apparently display dual functionality, performing both traditional and newly elucidated functions.

abstract = {The objective of this study was to identify, through multivariate analyses, the configuration of factors that most closely impact the development of pharyngocutaneous fistula (PCF). Incidence and treatment of PCF was also revisited. A retrospective longitudinal study of 218 patients who have undergone total laryngectomy (TL) was conducted in a tertiary academic referral center. There were 47 patients (21.6{\%}) developing PCF within 1 month after surgery (median 14 days, range 2-26 days). Non-surgical closure of the PCF was achieved in 36 patients (76.6{\%}) within a median of 16.5 days (range 8-27 days). Eleven patients (23.4{\%}) required a surgical closure of the PCF. In nine patients the surgical approach consisted in resuturing of the pharyngeal mucosa. Major surgery with the use of flaps (pectoralis major myocutaneous flap and free forearm flap) was required in two patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that diabetes mellitus (odd ratio 23.41 [95{\%} CI 8.46-64.78]), preoperative hypoalbuminemia (odd ratio 9.42 [95{\%} CI 3.60-24.61]), chronic pulmonary diseases (odd ratio 6.64 [95{\%} CI 1.97-22.56]) and chronic hepatopathy (odd ratio 3.26 [95{\%} CI 1.19-9.96]) were independent predictors for PCF formation. PCF results in prolonged hospitalization with increased medical costs, delay of adjuvant postoperative therapy and potentially life-threatening complications such as carotid rupture. In order to reduce the risk of PCF and avoid a delayed TL, optimization of comorbidities and correction of nutritional deficiencies with enteral or parenteral nutritional supplements should be achieved as early as possible.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Boogerd et al. Purpose: Intraoperative identification of rectal cancer (RC) can be challenging, especially because of fibrosis after treatment with preoperative chemo- and radiotherapy (CRT). Tumor-targeted fluorescence imaging can enhance the contrast between tumor and normal tissue during surgery. Promising targets for RC imaging are carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and the tyrosine-kinase receptor Met (c-Met). The effect of CRT on their expression determines their applicability for imaging. Therefore, we investigated whether CRT modifies expression patterns in tumors, lymph node (LN) metastases and adjacent normal rectal tissues. Patients and methods: Preoperative biopsies, primary tumor specimens and metastatic LNs were collected from 38 RC patients who did not receive CRT (cohort 1) and 34 patients who did (cohort 2). CEA, EpCAM and c-Met expression was determined using immunohistochemical staining and was semiquantified by a total immunostaining score (TIS), consisting of the percentage and intensity of stained tumor cells (0-12). Results: In both cohorts CEA, EpCAM and c-Met were significantly highly expressed in .60{\%} of tumor tissues compared with adjacent normal epithelium (T/N ratio, P,0.01). EpCAM showed the most homogenous expression in tumors, whereas CEA showed the highest T/N ratio. Most importantly, CEA and EpCAM expression did not significantly change in normal or neoplastic RC tissue after CRT, whereas levels of c-Met changed (P=0.02). Tissues of eight patients with a pathological complete response after CRT showed expression of all biomarkers with TIS close to normal epithelium. Conclusion: Histological evaluation shows that CEA, EpCAM and c-Met are suitable targets for RC imaging, because all three are significantly enhanced in cancer tissue from primary tumors or LN metastases compared with normal adjacent tissue. Furthermore, the expression of CEA and EpCAM is not significantly changed after CRT. These data underscore the applicability of c-Met and especially, CEA and EpCAM as targets for image-guided RC surgery, both before and after CRT.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To review our institution's recent experience with patients with carotid blowout syndrome who were referred for emergency diagnostic angiography and endovascular therapy. METHODS: Eighteen consecutive patients who had had surgery for cancer of the head and neck and in whom carotid blowout syndrome had occurred were referred to our service in accordance with a standardized protocol. RESULTS: Twenty-three angiographic pathoetiologic conditions were diagnosed in the 18 patients; the majority of these were pseudoaneurysms involving various segments of the carotid system. Multiple lesions were detected in five patients. Most patients were treated by means of permanent balloon occlusion; in 8 patients with either multiple lesions or impending rupture requiring flap reconstruction, a composite permanent balloon occlusion of the affected carotid system was performed. Hyperacute hemorrhages were arrested in all cases. Hemorrhages reoccurred in 2 cases, and in 2 patients who had permanent balloon occlusion of the internal carotid artery, transient ischemic attacks occurred, which appeared to be related to temporary collateral reserve failure. No permanent neurologic complications ensued. CONCLUSION: Our recent experience with carotid blowout syndrome suggests that this clinical diagnosis represents a heterogeneous group of angiographic pathoetiologies that the physician should evaluate carefully before proceeding with endovascular therapy. Specific endovascular approaches depend on the pathoetiologic mechanism of active or impending hemorrhage and the urgency with which intervention is required.},

As of October 2015, HCC candidates must wait 6 months after initial application to obtain exception points; the impact of this policy remains unstudied. Using 2013-2017 SRTR data, we identified 39 350 adult, first-time, active waitlist candidates and compared deceased donor liver transplant (DDLT) rates and waitlist mortality/dropout for HCC versus non-HCC candidates before (October 8, 2013-October 7, 2015, prepolicy) and after (October 8, 2015-October 7, 2017, postpolicy) the policy change using Cox and competing risks regression, respectively. Compared to non-HCC candidates with the same calculated MELD, HCC candidates had a 3.6-fold higher rate of DDLT prepolicy (aHR =  3.49 3.69 3.89 ) and a 2.2-fold higher rate of DDLT postpolicy (aHR =  2.09 2.21 2.34 ). Compared to non-HCC candidates with the same allocation priority, HCC candidates had a 37{\%} lower risk of waitlist mortality/dropout prepolicy (asHR =  0.54 0.63 0.73 ) and a comparable risk of mortality/dropout postpolicy (asHR =  0.81 0.95 1.11 ). Following the policy change, the DDLT advantage for HCC candidates remained, albeit dramatically attenuated, without any substantial increase in waitlist mortality/dropout. In the context of sickest-first liver allocation, the revised policy seems to have established allocation equity for HCC and non-HCC candidates.},

As the MELD score is driven in part by serum creatinine as a marker of kidney function, the prevalence of kidney dysfunction and failure in patients with end-stage liver disease at the time of listing and at transplantation has steadily risen. In this review, we discuss current practices in liver transplantation in patients with kidney dysfunction focusing briefly on the decision to perform simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation. We then discuss pitfalls to the current practices of liver transplantation in patients with kidney dysfunction. We conclude by discussing potential improvements to current practices including the use of the MELD-Na score, alternatives to creatinine and creatinine-based equation for estimating kidney function, and the use of intraoperative kidney replacement therapy during liver transplantation.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons Livers from older donors (OLDs; age ≥70) are risky and often declined; however, it is likely that some candidates will benefit from OLDs versus waiting for younger ones. To characterize the survival benefit of accepting OLD grafts, we used 2009-2017 SRTR data to identify 24 431 adult liver transplant (LT) candidates who were offered OLD grafts eventually accepted by someone. Outcomes from the time-of-offer were compared between candidates who accepted an OLD graft and matched controls within MELD ± 2 who declined the same offer. Candidates who accepted OLD grafts (n = 1311) were older (60.5 vs. 57.8 years, P {\textless}.001), had a higher median MELD score (25 vs. 22, P {\textless}.001), and were less likely to have hepatitis C cirrhosis (14.9{\%} vs. 31.2{\%}, P {\textless}.001). Five-year cumulative mortality among those who accepted versus declined the same OLD offer was 23.4{\%} versus 41.2{\%} (P {\textless}.001). Candidates who accepted OLDs experienced an almost twofold reduction in mortality (aHR:0.450.520.59, P {\textless}.001) compared to those who declined the same offer, especially among the highest MELD (35-40) candidates (aHR:0.100.240.55, P =.001). Accepting an OLD offer provided substantial long-term survival benefit compared to waiting for a better organ offer, notably among candidates with MELD 35-40. Providers should consider these benefits as they evaluate OLD graft offers.},

abstract = {The goal of pharyngeal reconstruction after laryngectomy is to prevent fistulization and to permit rapid resumption of satisfactory deglutition. Alaryngeal speech acquisition by the traditional method of esophageal speech is effective if insufflation is rapidly learned and tolerated by the pharyngoesophageal segment. Experience with tracheoesophageal phonation revealed an incidence of pharyngoesophageal spasm in 40{\%} of an esophageal speech failure population which prevented useful air flow for speech production. This is related to esophageal distention and reflexive upper esophageal sphincter hypertension. It is suggested that pharyngeal reconstruction after total laryngectomy may permit higher wall tension than is desirable for speech acquisition. The problem of post laryngectomy pharyngoesophageal spasm may be reduced by myotomy of the pharyngeal constrictors with resultant higher air flows in the residual vocal tract for speech. Alterations in the pharyngeal wall tonicity will affect the pitch of the speech and listener acceptability. Recently identification and division of the pharyngeal plexus has produced a similar result in improved phonatory air flows with subjective vocal pitch approximating more normal voices. The above mentioned techniques are readily applied to the laryngectomy procedure and enhance the likelihood of alaryngeal speech acquisition.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the utility of the pectoralis major muscle flap (PMMF) in patients undergoing salvage total laryngectomy. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis. SETTING: Tertiary care cancer center. PATIENTS: The study included 461 patients who underwent laryngectomy. Eighty of them underwent salvage surgery with primary pharyngeal closure. INTERVENTIONS: Of the 80 patients, 69 (86{\%}) underwent primary pharyngeal closure alone and 11 (14{\%}) underwent a PMMF, which was used to buttress the pharyngeal suture line. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Two hundred thirty-six variables were recorded for each patient. Complications related to pharyngeal closure were measured. RESULTS: Sixty-four percent of the patients who underwent PMMF also underwent chemoradiation therapy as the initial definitive treatment compared with 25{\%} in the non-PMMF group (P = .03). On multivariate analysis, chemoradiation therapy was the only independent predictor of pharyngocutaneous fistula formation (relative risk, 1.82; P = .02). Nevertheless, the pharyngocutaneous fistula rate was similar in the PMMF (27{\%}) and the non-PMMF (24{\%}) groups. Furthermore, similar durations of tube feeding, days to oral feeding, and hospitalization period were recorded in both groups. CONCLUSION: The PMMF should be used judiciously as a surgical adjunct in high-risk patients, with the goal of minimizing the risk for the development of a pharyngocutaneous fistula.},

The purpose of this review is to single out some relevant articles published on the topic of LFS from 2015 to mid-2016. Articles referring to injection laryngoplasty (augmentation) are entirely left aside. Recent findings In the vast majority of recent publications, LFS mostly addresses surgery intended to improve vocal function in cases of glottic insufficiency. Here, medialization laryngoplasties remain the most important surgery. Arytenoid adduction remains an important technique within this field. Some clinical studies concerning indications and outcome of LFS are covered in the recent articles, trying to improve decision making for the indication of medialization laryngoplasty to enhance the rate of favorable long-term results. As in the past years, only a few articles report on laboratory research and other aspects of LFS. Summary Articles published from 2015 to mid-2016 show that further improvements in LFS have been made, both surgically–technically and in respect of patient selection. There is still a debate about the combination of medialization laryngoplasty and arytenoid adduction in patients with unilateral vocal fold paralysis or paresis (UVFP). Although augmentation laryngoplasties are significantly increasing in number, it seems that LFS remains an important procedure within phonosurgery.},

One hundred and ten patients underwent primary closure and 62 patients had pectoralis major myofascial flap onlay. RESULTS The overall pharyngocutaneous fistula rate was 43 per cent, and was similar in both groups (primary closure group, 43.6 per cent; onlay flap group, 41.9 per cent; p = 0.8). Fistulae in the onlay flap group healed faster: the median and mean fistula duration were 37 and 55 days, respectively, in the primary closure group and 20 and 25 days, respectively, in the onlay flap group (p = 0.008). CONCLUSION Use of an onlay pectoralis major myofascial flap did not decrease the pharyngocutaneous fistula rate, although fistula duration was shortened.

A retrospective chart review was performed of 112 cases that were managed at a Medical College of Georgia tertiary care hospital by the senior author (E.S.P.). Patients were classified by the time of their presentation, the severity of their injury, and the treatment protocol followed. The clinical outcomes of airway, voice quality, and deglutition were retrospectively reviewed. For voice outcomes, in the delayed treatment group, only 27.7{\%} of patients had a good result, as compared to a 78.3{\%} good result in the early treatment group. Similar differences were demonstrated regarding the airway. In the delayed treatment group, only 73.3{\%} had good airway function, as compared to 93.3{\%} who had good airway function in the early treatment group. Ninety-nine percent of all patients had a good result for deglutition. We conclude that expeditious diagnosis and intervention reduce the incidence of suboptimal clinical outcomes, and with timely and appropriate application of diagnostic and management protocols, the majority of patients will be successfully decannulated (97{\%}) with functional speech (100{\%}) and normal deglutition (99{\%}).},

Study design: We evaluated patient and graft survival among pediatric liver-only transplant recipients the PELD/MELD system was implemented using the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. Results: From 2002-2009 to 2010-2015, survival for SLT at 30 days improved (94{\%} vs 98{\%}; P {\textless}.001), and at 1 year improved for SLT (89{\%} to 95{\%}; P {\textless}.001) and LDLT (93{\%} to 98{\%}; P =.002). There was no change in survival for whole liver transplant at either 30 days (98{\%} in both; P =.7) or 1 year (94{\%} vs 95{\%}; P =.2). The risk of early death with SLT was 2.14-fold higher in 2002-2009 (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] vs whole liver transplant,1.472.143.12), but this risk disappeared in 2010-2015 (aHR,0.651.131.96), representing a significant improvement (P =.04). Risk of late death after SLT was similar in both time periods (aHR 2002-2009,0.871.141.48; aHR 2010-2015,0.560.881.37). LDLT had similar risk of early death (aHR 2002-2009,0.491.032.14; aHR 2010-2015,0.260.742.10) and late death (aHR 2002-2009,0.520.831.32; aHR 2010-2015,0.170.441.11). Graft loss was similar for SLT (aHR,0.931.091.28) and was actually lower for LDLT (aHR,0.530.710.95). Conclusions: In recent years, outcomes after the use of technical variant grafts are comparable with whole grafts, and may be superior for LDLT. Greater use of technical variant grafts might provide an opportunity to increase organ supply without compromising post-transplant outcomes.},

abstract = {The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score has been successfully used to prioritize patients on the United States liver transplant waiting list since its adoption in 2002. The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)/Organ Procurement Transplantation Network (OPTN) allocation policy has evolved over the years, and notable recent changes include Share 35, inclusion of serum sodium in the MELD score, and a ‘delay and cap' policy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. We explored the potential of a registrant's change in 30-day MELD scores ($\Delta$MELD30) to improve allocation both before and after these policy changes. Current MELD and $\Delta$MELD30 were evaluated using cause-specific hazards models for waitlist dropout based on US liver transplant registrants added to the waitlist between 06/30/2003 and 6/30/2013. Two composite scores were constructed and then evaluated on UNOS data spanning the current policy era (01/02/2016 to 09/07/2018). Predictive accuracy was evaluated using the C-index for model discrimination and by comparing observed and predicted waitlist dropout probabilities for model calibration. After the change to MELD-Na, increased dropout associated with $\Delta$MELD30 jumps is no longer evident at MELD scores below 30. However, the adoption of Share 35 has potentially resulted in discrepancies in waitlist dropout for patients with sharp MELD increases at higher MELD scores. Use of the $\Delta$MELD30 to add additional points or serve as a potential tiebreaker for patients with rapid deterioration may extend the benefit of Share 35 to better include those in most critical need.},

The purpose of the present study was to determine the consistency of selected acoustic and aerodynamic measures of voice production over 28 days, under various test/retest conditions. Three groups of healthy young adult females sustained three vowels at comfortable, high, and low pitch levels. Subjects in Group 1 chose their own intensity levels, but matched the fundamental frequencies produced at Test 1 during Test 2. Group 2 controlled intensity levels during both tests, but fundamental frequency was free to vary. Group 3 controlled both intensity and fundamental frequency. Measures of fundamental frequency, jitter, maximum phonation time, phonation volume, and flow rate were compared. Subjects who matched both fundamental frequency and intensity showed repeatable, consistent results for all measures during both tests. Controlling intensity but not fundamental frequency resulted in statistically significant differences in fundamental frequency at comfortable and high pitches, but there was minimal effect on other variables. Controlling fundamental frequency but not intensity led to the most inconsistency between tests, affecting both acoustic and aerodynamic measures. Results underscore the need to control the conditions under which measures are obtained.},

High velocity blunt trauma (mostly traffic accidents) patients had more extensive injury and poor voice outcomes. Penetrating trauma patients due to physical assault or suicide attempt demonstrated more frequently injuries on the left side.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: In driver-caused traffic accidents, where injuries in a wide area within the larynx occurred, poor voice results were seen, and these injuries required aggressive treatment. When endotracheal intubation was performed at experienced emergency centers with fiberoptic laryngoscopes, airway management was safely achieved. In addition, if the fractured laryngeal framework was corrected at appropriate times, voice results were good.},

This nerve has been attributed to coughing during cerumen removal, neuralgic pain, Hitselberger's sign and vesicular eruptions described in Ramsay Hunt's syndrome. This study aimed to demonstrate the origin and clinical impact of this nerve. METHODS AND RESULTS In patients with intractable otalgia or severe coughing whilst inserting a hearing aid, who responded temporarily to local anaesthesia, the symptoms could be resolved by sectioning a sensory branch to the posterior canal. In a temporal bone specimen, it was revealed that this nerve is predominantly a continuation of Arnold's nerve, also receiving fibres from the glossopharyngeal nerve and facial nerve. Histologically, the communicating branch from the facial nerve was confirmed. CONCLUSION Surgeons should be aware of the posterior auricular sensory branch and its clinical implications.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Vocal fold medialization laryngoplasty (ML) and laryngeal reinnervation (LR) as treatments for unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) were compared in a multicenter, prospective, randomized clinical trial., METHODS: Previously untreated patients with UVFP were randomized to undergo either ML or LR. Voice results were compared pretreatment and at 6 and 12 months posttreatment using perceptual ratings by untrained listeners (RUL), blinded speech pathologist GRBAS scores, and voice-related quality of life (VRQOL) scores. Other secondary data included maximum phonation time (MPT), cepstral analysis, and electromyography (EMG) findings., RESULTS: Twenty-four patients from nine sites completed the study, 12 in each group. There were no significant intergroup differences in pretreatment variables. At 12 months, both study groups showed significant improvement in RUL, total GRBAS (grade, roughness, breathiness, asthenia, and strain) scores, and VRQOL scores, but no significant differences were found between the two groups. However, patient age significantly affected the LR, but not the ML, group results. The age less than 52 LR subgroup had significantly (P {\textless} .05) better scores than the age more than 52 LR subgroup, and had better RUL and GRBAS scores than the age less than 52 ML subgroup. The age more than 52 ML subgroup results were significantly better than the age more than 52 LR subgroup. The secondary data generally followed the primary data, except that the MPTs for the ML patients were significantly longer than for the LR patients., CONCLUSIONS: ML and LR are both effective surgical options for patients with UVFP. Laryngeal reinnervation should be considered in younger patients, whereas medialization laryngoplasty should be favored in older patients.

abstract = {The field of liver transplantation has shifted considerably in the MELD era, including changing allocation, immunosuppression, and liver failure etiologies, as well as better supportive therapies. Our aim was to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the MELD score over time. The United Network for Organ Sharing provided de-identified data on 120 156 patients listed for liver transplant from 2002-2016. The ability of the MELD score to predict 90-day mortality was evaluated by a concordance (C-) statistic and corroborated with competing risk analysis. The MELD score's concordance with 90-day mortality has downtrended from 0.80 in 2003 to 0.70 in 2015. While lab MELD scores at listing and transplant climbed in that interval, score at waitlist death remained steady near 35. Listing age increased from 50 to 54 years. HCV-positive status at listing dropped from 33 to 17{\%}. The concordance of MELD and mortality does not differ with age ({\textgreater}60 = 0.73, {\textless}60 = 0.74), but is lower in diseases that are increasing most rapidly—alcoholic liver disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease—and higher in those that are declining, particularly in HCV-positive patients (HCV positive = 0.77; negative = 0.73). While MELD still predicts mortality, its accuracy has decreased; changing etiology of disease may contribute.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess long-term results with consistent use of indwelling voice prostheses (Provox; Atos Medical AB, Horby, Sweden) for vocal rehabilitation after total laryngectomy. DESIGN: Retrospective clinical analysis. SETTING: Comprehensive national cancer center. PATIENTS: Three hundred eighteen patients (261 men and 57 women; mean age, 62 years) from November 1988, through May 1999. INTERVENTION: Standard wide-field total laryngectomy (287 patients) or total laryngectomy with circumferential pharyngeal resection (31 patients), and 2700 prosthesis replacements. Prostheses remained in situ during 364,339 days (1000 patient-years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Device lifetime, indications for replacement (device or fistula related), adverse events, and voice quality. RESULTS: Median patient-device follow-up was 67 months. Mean actuarial device lifetime for all indications for replacement was 163 days (median, 89 days). Main indications for replacement were device-related, ie, leakage through the prosthesis (73{\%}) and obstruction (4{\%}), or fistula-related, ie, leakage around the prosthesis (13{\%}), and hypertrophy and/or infection of the fistula (7{\%}). Adverse events occurred in 11{\%} of all replacements in one third of the patients, mostly solvable by a shrinkage period, or adequate sizing and/or antibiotic treatment. Definitive closure of the tracheoesophageal fistula tract occurred in 5{\%} of the patients. Significant clinical factors for increased device lifetime were no radiotherapy (P =.03), and age older than 70 years (P{\textless}.02). Success rate with respect to voice quality (ie, fair to excellent rating) was 88{\%}, which was significantly influenced by the extent of surgery (P{\textless}.001). CONCLUSION: The consistent use of indwelling voice prostheses shows a high success rate of prosthetic vocal rehabilitation, in terms of the percentage of long-term users (95{\%}), and of a fair-to-excellent voice quality (88{\%} of patients).},

Objective: To determine the survival benefit of solid-organ transplant as recorded during a 25-year study period in the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database and the Social Security Administration Death Master File. Design, Setting, And Participants: In this retrospective analysis of UNOS data for solid-organ transplant during a 25-year period (September 1, 1987, through December 31, 2012), we reviewed the records of 1 112 835 patients: 533 329 recipients who underwent a transplant and 579 506 patients who were placed on the waiting list but did not undergo a transplant. Main Outcomes And Measures: The primary outcomewas patient death while on the waiting list or after transplant. Kaplan-Meier survival functions were used for time-to-event analysis. Results: We found that 2 270 859 life-years (2 150 200 life-years from the matched analysis) were saved to date during the 25 years of solid-organ transplant. A mean of 4.3 life-years were saved (observed to date) per solid-organ transplant recipient.

abstract = {Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is characterized by acute decompensation (AD) of cirrhosis, organ failure(s), and high 28-day mortality. We investigated whether assessments of patients at specific time points predicted their need for liver transplantation (LT) or the potential futility of their care. We assessed clinical courses of 388 patients who had ACLF at enrollment, from February through September 2011, or during early (28-day) follow-up of the prospective multicenter European Chronic Liver Failure (CLIF) ACLF in Cirrhosis study. We assessed ACLF grades at different time points to define disease resolution, improvement, worsening, or steady or fluctuating course. ACLF resolved or improved in 49.2{\%}, had a steady or fluctuating course in 30.4{\%}, and worsened in 20.4{\%}. The 28-day transplant-free mortality was low-to-moderate (6{\%}-18{\%}) in patients with nonsevere early course (final no ACLF or ACLF-1) and high-to-very high (42{\%}-92{\%}) in those with severe early course (final ACLF-2 or -3) independently of initial grades. Independent predictors of course severity were CLIF Consortium ACLF score (CLIF-C ACLFs) and presence of liver failure (total bilirubin ≥12 mg/dL) at ACLF diagnosis. Eighty-one percent had their final ACLF grade at 1 week, resulting in accurate prediction of short- (28-day) and mid-term (90-day) mortality by ACLF grade at 3-7 days. Among patients that underwent early LT, 75{\%} survived for at least 1 year. Among patients with ≥4 organ failures, or CLIF-C ACLFs {\textgreater}64 at days 3-7 days, and did not undergo LT, mortality was 100{\%} by 28 days.

abstract = {Objective: Pharyngocutaneous fistula (PCF) is the most frequent complication after total laryngectomy. However, delayed oral feeding and inserting a nasogastric tube has been considered as a safe practice among head and neck surgeons, and there is no general agreement on the initiation of the oral intake. The aim of the study is to determine the incidence of PCF after primary total laryngectomy in a large homogenous case series and to evaluate whether fistula and early oral feeding are related. Methods: Patients who underwent total laryngectomy/laryngopharyngectomy with primary closure of pharynx between 1990 and 2014 were reviewed. Patients who had a history of previous radiotherapy, chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy, and patients who underwent more complex reconstruction techniques (e.g. pedicled or free flaps) for closure were excluded. In total, 602 patients underwent total laryngectomy (n = 580) or total laryngectomy plus partial pharyngectomy (n = 22). Results: The overall PCF rate was 12{\%}. In 582 of the 602 patients (99.8{\%}), a nasogastric tube was not inserted. In 95.7{\%} of the patients (576/602), oral feeding was started within 3 days of surgery. Among the patients who developed PCF (72/602), PCF rate was not significantly higher in early oral fed patients (69/582, 11.8{\%}) than the patients with nasogastric tube insertion (3/20, 15{\%}) (p = 0.722). Conclusion: The low PCF rate in our study indicates that early oral feeding is a safe and effective method in primary total laryngectomy.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is characterised by the presence of organ failure in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and is associated with high short-term mortality. However, there are limited data on the prevalence and short-term outcomes of ACLF in patients with cirrhosis seen in the US. We aimed to study the prevalence and risk factors associated with the development and short term mortality in a large cohort of patients in the US. Methods: Using the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Corporate Data Warehouse, we identified patients with ACLF during hospitalisation for decompensated cirrhosis at any of the 127 VA hospitals between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2014. We examined the prevalence of ACLF and variables associated with 28- and 90-day mortality in ACLF, and trends in prevalence and survival over time. Results: Of 72,316 patients hospitalised for decompensated cirrhosis, 19,082 (26.4{\%}) patients met the criteria of ACLF on admission. Of these, 12.8{\%} had 1, 10.1{\%} had 2, and 3.5{\%} had 3 or more organ failures. Overall, 25.5{\%} and 40.0{\%} of ACLF patients died within 28 days and 90 days of admission, respectively. Older age, White race, liver cancer, higher model for end-stage liver disease sodium corrected score, and non-liver transplant centre were associated with increased risk of death in ACLF. Over the study period, the prevalence of ACLF decreased, and all grades but ACLF-3 had improvement in survival. Conclusions: In a US cohort of hospitalised patients with decompensated cirrhosis, ACLF was common and associated with high short-term mortality. Over a decade, ACLF prevalence decreased but survival improvement of ACLF-3 was not seen. Early recognition and aggressive management including timely referral to transplant centres may lead to improved outcomes in ACLF. Lay summary: Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a condition marked by multiple organ failures in patients with cirrhosis and associated with a high risk of death. In this study of US patients hospitalised with cirrhosis, 1 in 4 patients developed ACLF. In total, 25{\%} of patients with ACLF died within 1 month and 40{\%} died within 3 months. Thus, early recognition of ACLF is important for the initiation of aggressive management, which is required to save these patients' lives.},

abstract = {To optimize tracheoesophageal (TO) speech after total laryngectomy, it is vital to have a robust tool of assessment to help investigate deficiencies, document changes, and facilitate therapy. We sought to evaluate and validate electroglottography (EGG) as an important tool in the multidimensional assessment of TO speech. This study is a cross-sectional study of the largest cohort of TO speakers treated by a single surgeon. A second group of normal laryngeal speakers served as a control group. EGG analysis of both groups using connected speech and sustained vowels was performed. Two trained expert raters undertook perceptual evaluation using two accepted scales. EGG measures were then analyzed for correlation with treatment variables. A separate correlation analysis was performed to identify EGG measures that may be associated with perceptual dimensions. Our data from EGG analysis are similar to data obtained from conventional acoustic signal analysis of TO speakers. Sustained vowel and connected speech parameters were poorer in TO speakers than in normal laryngeal speakers. In perceptual evaluation, only grade (G) of the GRBAS scale and Overall Voice Quality appeared reproducible and reliable. T stage, pharyngeal reconstruction and method of closure, cricopharyngeal myotomy, and postoperative complications appear to be correlated with the EGG measures. Five voice measures-jitter, shimmer, average frequency, normalized noise energy, and irregularity-correlated well with the key dimensions of perceptual assessment. EGG is an important assessment tool of TO speech, and can now be reliably used in a clinical setting. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Voice Foundation.},

abstract = {Background/Aims: The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) has been used to prioritize cirrhotic patients awaiting liver transplantation. The change in MELD score over time ($\Delta$MELD) may have additional prognostic value. We investigated the ability of $\Delta$MELD to predict the outcome of advanced cirrhosis and prospectively assessed the factors associated with increasing $\Delta$MELD. Methods: Risk factors were determined in 58 prospectively followed-up patients. The predictive power of $\Delta$MELD, initial MELD and Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score was compared by using c-statistic in 351 patients. Results: Ascites (P=0.020) and hepatic encephalopathy (P=0.023) were significantly associated with increasing MELD score at 3 months. The area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for $\Delta$MELD/month was 0.779 compared with 0.718 for MELD (P=0.130) and 0.528 for CTP score (P{\textless}0.001) at 6 months; the area was 0.822, 0.744 and 0.528, respectively (P=0.018 and {\textless}0.001, respectively) at 12 months. $\Delta$MELD/month {\textgreater}2.5 was the only significant prognostic predictor at 6 (odds ratio: 9.8, P{\textless}0.001) and 12 months (odds ratio: 16.3, P{\textless}0.001) in multivariate logistic analysis. Conclusions: Increasing MELD score is associated with the onset of ascites and encephalopathy. $\Delta$MELD is superior to initial MELD and CTP scores to predict intermediate term outcome in patients with advanced cirrhosis. {\textcopyright} 2005 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

abstract = {We conducted a retrospective, matched-cohort, case-control study to compare complication rates associated with two wound closure procedures-stapling vs. traditional hand suturing-following total laryngectomy. Our study population was made up of 42 consecutively presenting patients-38 men and 4 women, aged 34 to 92 years (mean: 60.3) whose pharyngotomies were amenable to primary closure. Of this group, 37 patients had active endolaryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 2 patients had inactive endolaryngeal SCC, 2 patients had thyroid cancer, and 1 patient had been treated for chronic aspiration. A total of 26 patients (61.9{\%}) had undergone traditional suture closure of the neopharynx (suture group) and 16 patients (38.1{\%}) had undergone closure with a linear stapling device (staple group). Other than the fact that the patients in the staple group were significantly older than those in the suture group (median: 71.0 vs. 56.5 yr, p = 0.002), there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of comorbidities or cricopharyngeal myotomy, tracheoesophageal puncture, or neck dissection. There was a total of 8 postoperative infections-5 in the staple group (31.3{\%}) and 3 in the suture group (11.5{\%})-not a statistically significant difference. Fistulas occurred in 4 staple patients (25.0{\%}) and 6 suture patients (23.1{\%})-again, not statistically significant. We conclude that in appropriately selected patients, primary closure of the neopharynx can be safely and effectively achieved with a linear stapling device.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: There continues to be controversy about the added role of arytenoid adduction (AA) in the rehabilitation of unilateral vocal cord paralysis (UVCP). Some authors feel that the added morbidity of AA is not warranted in UVCP rehabilitation. Objective analysis of acoustic and aerodynamic measures were performed before and after surgery to try to resolve this controversy., METHODS: This is an institutional review board-approved retrospective study of 85 patients with UVCP undergoing surgical rehabilitation by injection laryngoplasty (n = 45), medialization laryngoplasty (n = 14), or medialization laryngoplasty with arytenoid adduction (n = 26). Acoustic and aerodynamic parameters were studied before and after surgery. The medialization laryngoplasty (ML) group (medialization alone, injection laryngoplasty ML/IL) data were compared to the AA-ML group using a paired t test for the individual measures and analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the multivariate analysis of acoustic and aerodynamic measures., RESULTS: In all treatment arms there were statistically significant improvements in all acoustic and aerodynamic measures after intervention (P {\textless} .05). For ML and IL, the mean difference between preoperative from postoperative jitter was 1.504{\%}, shimmer 3.265{\%}, noise to harmonic ratio (NHR) 0.036, mean phonation time 4.523 seconds, transglottic flow 0.130 L/s, and subglottic pressure 0.616 cm H2O. For AA-ML the mean difference between preoperative and postoperative jitter was 2.431{\%}, shimmer 6.068{\%}, NHR 0.082, mean phonation time 6.74 seconds, flow 0.181 L/s, and subglottic pressure 0.611 cm H2. Preoperatively, the average phonatory function of the AA-ML group was worse than the ML group. Comparison between the two treatment arms, individual acoustic and aerodynamic measures, were not different (paired t test, P {\textless} .05). However, mulitvariate analysis (ANOVA, P {\textless} .05) of acoustic and aerodynamic measures, showed a statistically significant difference between the two groups. The degree of change was significantly better in the AA-ML group., CONCLUSIONS: AA-ML and IL/ML improve phonatory function, but not to normal. We were unable to demonstrate a statistical difference between groups using a single measure, but using mutlivariate analysis, there is a statistical significance between the groups. AA-ML patients had worse preoperative function and had better postoperative function. When clinically indicated, AA-ML procedure does appear to correct the physiology of the incompetent larynx better than ML alone.},

abstract = {Background and Aims: The United Network for Organ Sharing's Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (UNOS-MELD) score is the basis of liver allocation in the Eurotransplant region. It was constructed 20 years ago in a small US cohort and has remained unchanged ever since. The best boundaries and coefficients were never calculated for any region outside the United States. Therefore, this study refits the MELD (reMELD) for the Eurotransplant region. Approach and Results: All adult patients listed for a first liver transplantation between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2018, were included. Data were randomly split in a training set (70{\%}) and a validation set (30{\%}). In the training data, generalized additive models with splines were plotted for each MELD parameter. The lower and upper bound combinations with the maximum log-likelihood were chosen for the final models. The refit models were tested in the validation data with C-indices and Brier scores. Through likelihood ratio tests the refit models were compared to UNOS-MELD. The correlation between scores and survival of prioritized patients was calculated. A total of 6,684 patients were included. Based on training data, refit parameters were capped at creatinine 0.7-2.5, bilirubin 0.3-27, international normalized ratio 0.1-2.6, and sodium 120-139. ReMELD and reMELD-Na showed C-indices of 0.866 and 0.869, respectively. ReMELD-Na prioritized patients with 1.6 times higher 90-day mortality probabilities compared to UNOS-MELD. Conclusions: Refitting MELD resulted in new lower and upper bounds for each parameter. The predictive power of reMELD-Na was significantly higher than UNOS-MELD. ReMELD prioritized patients with higher 90-day mortality rates. Thus, reMELD(-Na) should replace UNOS-MELD for liver graft allocation in the Eurotransplant region.},

abstract = {Larynx is the second most common site for cancer in the upper aerodigestive tract. One of the dreaded complications following total laryngectomy has been pharyngo cutaneous fistula (PCF). PCF merits special attention due to its significant negative impact on the recovery process. Total laryngectomy profoundly alters speech. Effective voice restoration is essential for the rehabilitation of these patients. Inadequate consensus exists as to the best technique of pharyngeal repair to decrease incidence of PCF and ensure good quality voice following total laryngectomy. 21 patients were included in the study for total laryngectomy with trachea oesophageal voice prosthesis placement. Patients were randomised into 2 groups. Group A had their pharynx repaired in two layers and Group B had it done in three layers. Post operatively the patients were followed up for a period of 12 months to look for incidence of PCF. Subjective and objective evaluation of voice was done. 9.52{\%} of patients developed PCF. All of the cases of PCF were in the group repaired in three layers. In cases with repair by two layers the mean Voice Handicap Index 10 (VHI 10) score was 19.27 and those with three layers pharyngeal repair was 23.20. Average maximum phonation time amongst the study population was 13.09. In three layers and two layers pharyngeal repair the average maximum phonation time was 12.56 and 13.58 respectively. Surgical repair of pharynx in two layers excluding the third layer of pharyngeal musculature reduces the chance of PCF. Two layers pharyngeal repair supplemented by cricopharyngeal myotomy led to significantly better voice outcome.},

abstract = {We previously suggested that in patients with heptocellular carcinoma (HCC), the conventional Milan criteria (T1/T2) for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) could be modestly expanded based on pathology (UCSF criteria). The present study was undertaken to prospectively validate the UCSF criteria based on pretransplant imaging. Over a 5-year period, the UCSF criteria were used as selection guidelines for OLT in 168 patients, including 38 patients exceeding Milan but meeting UCSF criteria (T3A). The 1- and 5-year recurrence-free probabilities were 95.9{\%} and 90.9{\%}, and the respective survivals without recurrence were 92.1{\%} and 80.7{\%}. Patients with preoperative T1/T2 HCC had 1- and 5-year recurrence-free probabilities of 95.7{\%} and 90.1{\%}, respectively, versus 96.9{\%} and 93.6{\%}, respectively, for preoperative T3A stage (p = 0.58). Under-staging was observed in 20{\%} of T2 and 29{\%} of T3A HCC (p = 0.26). When explant tumor exceeded UCSF criteria (15{\%}), the 1- and 5-year recurrence-free probabilities were 80.4{\%} and 59.5{\%}, versus 98.6{\%} and 96.7{\%}, respectively, for those within UCSF criteria (p {\textless} 0.0001). In conclusion, our results validated the ability of the UCSF criteria to discriminate prognosis after OLT and to serve as selection criteria for OLT, with a similar risk of tumor recurrence and under-staging when compared to the Milan criteria. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: This study aimed to develop a survival prediction model that might aid decision making when choosing between best supportive care (BSC) and brain radiotherapy (RT) for patients with brain metastases and limited survival expectation., METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 124 patients treated with BSC, whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), or radiosurgery was conducted. All patients had adverse prognostic features defined as 0-1.5 points according to the diagnosis-specific graded prognostic assessment score (DS-GPA) or GPA if primary tumor type was not among those represented in DS-GPA. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared between patients treated with BSC or RT in different scenarios, reflecting more or less rigorous definitions of poor prognosis. If survival was indistinguishable and this result could be confirmed in multivariate analysis, BSC was considered appropriate., RESULTS: Irrespective of point sum examined, DS-GPA by itself was not a satisfactory selection parameter. However, we defined a subgroup of 63 patients (51 {\%}) with short survival irrespective of management approach (only 5 {\%} of irradiated patients survived beyond 6 months; they had newly diagnosed, treatment-naive lung cancer), i.e., patients in whom foregoing RT was unlikely to compromise survival. These were patients with 0-1.5 points and aged {\textgreater} 75 years, had Karnofsky performance status {\textless} 50, or had uncontrolled primary tumor with extracranial metastases to at least two organs., CONCLUSIONS: BSC is a reasonable choice in patients with limited life expectancy. After successful external validation of the selection criteria developed in this analysis, identification of patients who are unlikely to benefit from WBRT might be improved.},

Cirrhosis is currently the 11th most common cause of death globally and liver cancer is the 16th leading cause of death; combined, they account for 3.5{\%} of all deaths worldwide. Cirrhosis is within the top 20 causes of disability-adjusted life years and years of life lost, accounting for 1.6{\%} and 2.1{\%} of the worldwide burden. About 2 billion people consume alcohol worldwide and upwards of 75 million are diagnosed with alcohol-use disorders and are at risk of alcohol-associated liver disease. Approximately 2 billion adults are obese or overweight and over 400 million have diabetes; both of which are risk factors for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. The global prevalence of viral hepatitis remains high, while drug-induced liver injury continues to increase as a major cause of acute hepatitis. Liver transplantation is the second most common solid organ transplantation, yet less than 10{\%} of global transplantation needs are met at current rates. Though these numbers are sobering, they highlight an important opportunity to improve public health given that most causes of liver diseases are preventable.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To offer a practical demonstration of regression models recommended for count outcomes using longitudinal predictors of children's medically attended injuries. METHOD: Participants included 708 children from the NICHD child care study. Measures of temperament, attention, parent-child relationship, and safety of physical environment were used to predict medically attended injuries. RESULTS: Statistical comparisons among five estimation methods revealed that a zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) model provided the best fit with observed data. ZIP models simultaneously model dichotomous and continuous outcomes of count variables, and different constellations of predictors emerged for each aspect of the estimated model. CONCLUSIONS: This study offers a practical demonstration of techniques designed to handle dependent count variables. The conceptual and statistical advantages of these methods are emphasized, and Stata script is provided to facilitate adoption of these techniques.},

One donor with a glioblastoma multiforme transmitted fatal tumors to three recipients. One donor with a history of melanoma 32 years earlier transmitted a fatal melanoma to a single recipient and, therefore, donors with a history of melanoma should not be used.

In this paper, we first provide a literature review on the parameters' influence on the prediction performance and on variable importance measures. It is well known that in most cases RF works reasonably well with the default values of the hyperparameters specified in software packages. Nevertheless, tuning the hyperparameters can improve the performance of RF. In the second part of this paper, after a presenting brief overview of tuning strategies, we demonstrate the application of one of the most established tuning strategies, model-based optimization (MBO). To make it easier to use, we provide the tuneRanger R package that tunes RF with MBO automatically. In a benchmark study on several datasets, we compare the prediction performance and runtime of tuneRanger with other tuning implementations in R and RF with default hyperparameters.

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In a retrospective case-control study in 71 patients after TLE with primary closure (i e. without reconstruction with tissue transfer), complications and hospitalisation in 36 patients who started oral feeding on days 3-5 (early feeding) were compared with 30 patients who started oral feeding on days 7-10 (late feeding). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of complications, swallowing function and duration of hospitalisation. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the early- and late-feeding groups in the occurrence of pharyngocutaneous fistulae, neopharyngeal stenosis or wound complications in general. Swallowing function was comparable for both groups. Mean overall hospitalisation was 2 days shorter in the early-feeding group (mean: 17.4 days) as compared to the late-feeding group (mean: 19.4 days) (P {\textless} 0.05).

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Using optical coherence tomography (OCT) to image the larynx during diagnosis and treatment of a vast array of laryngeal disorders continues to develop along with innovative surgical techniques. Precise delineation of vocal fold-layered microstructure allows for better understanding of the impact of benign and malignant lesions on laryngeal function, and optical coherence is uniquely suited to provide detail of the interface between these lesions and adjacent normal tissue. This review provides the reader with a timely update on current clinical and research applications of OCT. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent advances in OCT include adaptation of these modalities to obtain images of moving vocal folds and provide real-time information during procedures. Additionally, an augmented form of OCT called polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) shows promise in further characterizing benign and malignant lesions and in delineating areas of normal pliability from scar. PS-OCT can quantify areas of increased collagen (scar) and three-dimensional PS-OCT imaging can visualize the extent and location of lesions within vocal folds. SUMMARY: Imaging the layered microstructure of vocal folds to precisely delineate boundaries between normal pliability and scar provides valuable information during diagnosis and treatment of benign and malignant disorders. Current OCT imaging techniques are guiding phonomicrosurgical interventions and improving patient care.},

Methods: A retrospective, institutional review board-approved study at a university-based hospital. A total of 81 patients consisting of 55 Bell's palsy patients and 26 HZO patients were enrolled in this study. The treatment consisted uniformly in all cases, and acyclovir was administered in the case of Ramsay Hunt syndrome. All patients were followed up until they recovered or for least up 6 months. Results: The recovery rates to House-Brackmann grade II or better were 96.3{\%} in those with Bell's palsy and 84.6{\%} in those with HZO. In the HZO cases, older patients had a poorer initial and final status, and less chance of making a complete recovery than the younger patients. The HZO patients without diabetes mellitus had a higher chance of recovery, a higher chance of complete recovery, and a better final status. In addition, HZO patients without essential hypertension had a higher degree of recovery. HZO patients not suffering from vertigo had a higher chance of recovery.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mortality after liver transplantation depends on heterogeneous recipient and donor factors. Our aim was to assess risk of death and to develop models to help predict mortality after liver transplantation. METHODS: We analysed data from 34,664 first adult liver transplants from the European Liver Transplant Registry to identify factors associated with mortality at 3-months (n=21,605 in training dataset) and 12-months (n=18,852 in training dataset) after transplantation. We used multivariable logistic regression models to generate mortality scores for each individual, and assessed model discrimination and calibration on an independent validation dataset (n=9489 for 3-month model and n=8313 for 12-month model). FINDINGS: 2540 of 21,605 (12{\%}) individuals in the 3-month training sample had died by 3 months. Compared with those transplanted in 2000-03, those transplanted earlier had a higher risk of death. Increased mortality at 3-months post-transplantation was associated with acute liver failure (adjusted odds ratio 1.61), donor age older than 60 years (1.16), compatible (1.22) or incompatible (2.07) donor-recipient blood group, older recipient age (1.12 per 5 years), split or reduced graft (1.96), total ischaemia time of longer than 13 h (1.38), and low United Network for Organ Sharing score (score 1: 2.43; score 2: 1.67). However, cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma, alcohol cirrhosis, hepatitis C or primary biliary cirrhosis, donor age 40 years or younger, or less, hepatitis B, and larger size of transplant centre ({\textgreater} or = 70 transplants per year) were associated with improved early outcomes. The 3-month mortality score discriminated well between those who did and did not die in the validation sample (C statistic=0.688). We noted similar findings for 12-month mortality, although deaths were generally underestimated at this timepoint. INTERPRETATION: The 3-month and 12-month mortality models can be effectively used to assess outcomes both within and between centres. Furthermore, the models provide a means of assessing the risk of post-transplantation mortality, giving clinicians important data on which to base strategic decisions about transplant policy in particular individuals or groups.},

abstract = {The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) allocation system for liver transplantation provides "exceptions" for diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It was the aim of this study to assess equipoise between exception candidates and nonexception candidates on the waiting list and to assess if the exception system contributes to steadily increasing regional MELD at transplant. In all, 78,595 adult liver transplant candidates between January 2005 and December 2012 were analyzed. Yearly trends in waiting list characteristics and transplantation rates were analyzed for statistical association with MELD exceptions. Regional variations in these associations and the effect of exceptions on regional MELD scores at transplant were also analyzed. 27.29{\%} of the waiting list was occupied by candidates with exceptions. Candidates with exceptions fared much better on the waiting list compared to those without exceptions in mean days waiting (HCC 237 versus non-HCC 426), transplantation rates (HCC 79.05{\%} versus non-HCC 40.60{\%}), and waiting list death rates (HCC 4.49{\%} versus non-HCC 24.63{\%}). Strong regional variation in exception use occurred but exceptions were highly correlated with waiting list death rates, transplantation rates, and MELD score at removal in all regions. In a multivariate model predicting MELD score at transplant within regions, the percentage of HCC MELD exceptions was the strongest independent predictor of regional MELD score at transplant. Conclusion: Liver transplant candidates with MELD exceptions have superior outcomes compared to nonexception candidates and the current MELD exception system is largely responsible for steadily increasing MELD scores at transplant independent of geography.},

abstract = {As standard stroboscopy is restricted to the recording of periodic vocal fold vibrations, observations of non-stationary laryngeal mechanisms demand real-time recording systems, the most advanced being the high-speed video technique. It allows the registration of laryngeal parameters during a variation of the fundamental frequency. The aim of this study was to compare amplitude and frequency parameters of vocal fold vibration during stationary and non-stationary phonation, i.e. a monotonous pitch rise. Twenty-nine young female adults with no incidence of voice disorders were examined while performing two different phonation tasks: sustained phonation with a constant frequency and a monotonous pitch rise. Endoscopic recordings and the acoustic signals were acquired simultaneously. Both acoustic and laryngeal parameters were derived for short time intervals of 17.8 ms for the constant pitch and pitch rise conditions. Instantaneous frequency, sound pressure level, vibratory amplitudes of the vocal folds and the type of glottal closure were compared. At the beginning of the pitch rise, the acoustic and laryngeal parameters were similar to the parameters that occurred within the sustained phonation conditions. In contrast, the laryngeal parameters at the middle and at the end of the pitch rise differed substantially from those during sustained phonation. For the first time, quantitative measures of the growing glottal chink and the vibration amplitude decrease during pitch increase could be taken. In general, the image evaluation of the pitch rise paradigm can be subdivided into the starting, the raising and the final phase. As each phase can be considered as quasi-stationary, existing software modules are capable of analysing the process by treating each phase separately. Hence, the pitch rise condition may be suitable for clinical examination to detect information of voice disturbances that cannot be visualized during sustained phonation.},

abstract = {Background: Physicians utilize different types of information to predict patient prognosis. For example: confronted with a new patient suffering from severe aortic stenosis (AS), the cardiologist considers not only the severity of the AS but also patient characteristics, medical history, and markers such as BNP. Intuitively, doctors adjust their prediction of prognosis over time, with the change in clinical status, aortic valve area and BNP at each outpatient clinic visit. With the help of novel statistical approaches to model outcomes, it is now possible to construct dynamic event prediction models, employing longitudinal data such as AVA and BNP, and mimicking the dynamic adjustment of prognosis as employed intuitively by cardiologists. We illustrate dynamic prediction of patient survival and freedom from intervention, using baseline patient characteristics and longitudinal BNP data that are becoming available over time, from a cohort of patients with severe aortic stenosis. Methods: A 3-step approach was employed: (1) construction of a mixed-effects model to describe temporal BNP progression, (2) jointly modeling the mixed-effects model with time-to-event data (death and freedom from intervention), and (3) using the joint model to build subject-specific prediction risk models. The dataset used for this purpose includes 191 patients with severe aortic stenosis who were followed over a 3-year time period. Results: In the mixed-effects model BNP was significantly influenced by time, baseline patient age, gender, LV fractional ejection fraction and creatinine. Additionally, the joint model showed that an increasing BNP trend over time was found to be a significant predictor of death. Conclusions: By jointly modeling longitudinal data with time-to-event outcomes it is possible to construct individualized dynamic event prediction models that renew over time with accumulating evidence. It provides a potentially valuable evidence-based tool for everyday use in medical practice.},
